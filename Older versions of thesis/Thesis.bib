In this paper we explore the accuracy of using self-reported estimates when compared with actual smartphone use. We also include source code to process and visualise these data. We compared 23 participants' actual smartphone use over a two-week period with self-reported estimates and the Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale. Our results indicate that estimated time spent using a smartphone may be an adequate measure of use, unless a greater resolution of data are required. Estimates concerning the number of times an individual used their phone across a typical day did not correlate with actual smartphone use. Neither estimated duration nor number of uses correlated with the Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale. We conclude that estimated smartphone use should be interpreted with caution in psychological research.},

Research on the role of school psychologists has focused on the perceptions of school staff in relation to ideal services, and has given little acknowledgment to the expectations of other clients of school psychologists, such as parents. Common understanding of the range and focus of services available from school psychologists would facilitate effective and appropriate referrals. Services are considered according to models of service delivery from systemic service to an individual case-based model. The current study involved 138 school psychologists, 107 parents, and 100 teachers from government, Catholic, and independent schools across Melbourne, Australia. Participants completed a number of measures, and significant differences between groups were found on 20 of the 30 items relating to school psychologists' responsibilities (p {$<$} .001). Associations were also established between student\textendash psychologist ratios and the work practices of school psychologists, specifically the frequency with which assessment (r = .35, p {$<$} .001) and counselling (r =-.25, p {$<$} .01) tasks were undertaken. It is concluded that service delivery would benefit by enhancing community understanding of the work of school psychologists. Analysis of work practices reflects that demand for assessment services tends to limit the development of systemic and preventative practices in the work of school psychologists.},

  abstract = {The aim of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of a recently developed tool for measuring perceptions of the effectiveness of Educational Psychology (EP) interventions. The research project was derived following an adaptation of Goal Attainment Scaling into a revised format known as Target Monitoring and Evaluation (TME). Evidence was sought as to its utility within an EP service by investigating the reliability and validity of TME and whether or not this system could be used as a means to evaluate the efficacy of EP-led interventions in schools. Effective service delivery issues were considered by investigating the usability of TME, and evidence was sought from EP and school based colleagues with experience of using TME in order to investigate the practical, operational and commitment issues. Within a mixed methods design the research aim was to compare the quantitative objective utility of TME (in which outcomes for children derived from TME were set against measurements of change from more "conventional" assessment tools) with the qualitative perceived utility of TME (including EP and teacher opinions of the efficacy of TME). The intention was to investigate the reliability and validity \textemdash{} and therefore credibility \textemdash{} of the TME approach by using an external point of reference and comparing perceptions of change measured by TME, compared to a more conventional quantitative measure of change. The research focused specifically on clearly defined and related interventions, in order that TME measures of change could be compared with existing conventional measurement tools. These focused on a total of 24 TME cases completed for children within Key Stage 2 in mainstream primary schools. Quantitative "objective" data relating to both baseline and outcome measures were collected using either a standardised literacy assessment or observation schedule. These were contrasted with teacher-based perceptions of baseline and change at outcome as measured by the TME process. The quantitative outcomes were investigated against the qualitative perceptions of the utility of TME via individual interviews with 10 EPs and 8 Special Educational Needs Coordinators (SENCOs) from schools who had experience of using TME. Each interview was transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. In the analysis, where positive progress was noted using TME, this was also usually observed using the more conventional forms of evaluation. However, there were inconsistencies in relation to the level of change in each case. The outcomes suggest TME was well regarded as a tool for assisting the process of setting up interventions and as a framework for the discussion at review. TME appeared less well regarded as an evaluative tool to measure outcomes for the EP service, and there were implications for increased support and training. From an evidence-based perspective, it may seem logical that the key element of EP evaluation ought to be based upon successful outcomes for children. However, according to the qualitative analysis, there were many bigger questions about such evaluations, for example, defining the nature of the EP's role, the difficulty in separating elements of influence, and the delivery of services through others.},

However, the impact of educational psychologists' (EPs') practice can be difficult to ascertain, particularly within consultation where resultant actions are often implemented by other professionals. This action research, conducted within two EPSs, sought first to find possible frameworks for evaluating consultation, via literature review. Thereafter, qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analysed with EPs, leading to the identification of two preferred frameworks: Appreciative Inquiry (AI) and the Constructionist Model of Informed Reasoned Action (COMOIRA), which were piloted and reviewed. In the final research phase, focus groups considered their usefulness as evaluation tools. Despite some promising findings, variation amongst EPs' views about their applicability, perhaps influenced by previous familiarity with the frameworks, suggested the need for further research in this area.},

It begins by commenting on recent evidence which suggests that, despite exhortations to the contrary, many EPs continue to promote non-inclusive ways of working. It then discusses the possibility that the discipline of psychology can, itself, promote an approach to EP practice which is often construed as actively supporting a segregated system of education. This is followed by a review of the evidence suggesting that EPs are abandoning their traditional routes in psychology and adopting school based consultation as a method or working that is more inclusive. The article concludes by referring in some detail to two examples of projects in which EPs have shown that it is possible for them to work in alternative ways with schools and local authorities to promote inclusion.},

Next, survey designers can subject the items to (5) an expert review and (6) cognitive pretesting before executing a pilot test.},

The material is organized so that the discrete and continuous probability discussions are presented in a separate, but parallel, manner. This organization does not emphasize an overly rigorous or formal view of probabililty and therefore offers some strong pedagogical value. Hence, the discrete discussions can sometimes serve to motivate the more abstract continuous probability discussions. Features: Key ideas are developed in a somewhat leisurely style, providing a variety of interesting applications to probability and showing some nonintuitive ideas. Over 600 exercises provide the opportunity for practicing skills and developing a sound understanding of ideas. Numerous historical comments deal with the development of discrete probability.

Following a 14-week period during which advanced school psychology graduate students served as consultants in the treatment schools, the Pupil Problem Behavior Inventory (PPBI) was administered to all teachers. The results of a repeated measures MANOVA analysis indicated that the teachers in the treatment group rated the acting out and academic problems on the PPBI as significantly less severe than did teachers in the control group.

This research introduced Farouk's process consultation approach in three Irish mainstream primary schools and evaluated the consultation groups over one academic year. The schools were selected based on their level of referrals to the educational psychologist (EP) for pupils presenting with behavioural difficulties. The study utilised a mixed methods design comprising mainly qualitative and some quantitative analysis. The data were obtained from participant and researcher reflections, interviews and questionnaires. Thematic analysis was used to derive themes from the data. The results suggest that the groups provided the teachers with an organised time for discussion, information-sharing and learning, which enhanced their behaviour management skills through the sharing of strategies and their implementation through teamwork. However, due to the poor return of teacher questionnaires it is not possible to derive any definite conclusions.},

The objective of the current review was to evaluate disparities or similarities between self-report and objective measures of driving behavior. Methods Searches were undertaken in the following electronic databases, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Scopus, for peer-reviewed full-text articles that (1) focused on road safety, and (2) compared both subjective and objective measures of driving performance or driver safety. A total of 22,728 articles were identified, with 19 articles, comprising 20 studies, included as part of the review. Results The research reported herein suggested that for some behaviors (e.g., driving in stressful situations) there were similarities between self-report and objective measures while for other behaviors (e.g., sleepiness and vigilance states) there were differences between these measurement techniques. In addition, findings from some studies suggested that in-vehicle devices may be a valid measurement tool to assess driving exposure in older drivers. Conclusions Further research is needed to examine the correspondence between self-report and objective measures of driving behavior. In particular, there is a need to increase the number of studies which compare ``like with like'' as it is difficult to draw comparisons when there are variations in measurement tools used. Practical applications Incorporating a range of objective and self-report measurements tools in research would help to ensure that the methods used offer the most reliable measures of assessing on-road behaviors.},

Ten EPs completed a pre-consultation questionnaire and audio-taped at least one initial teacher consultation, generating 17 case studies. The contents of the questionnaires and consultation transcripts were analysed using WinMax qualitative data analysis software. The analysis indicated that consultants' espoused theories were based on three models: solution-focused thinking, systemic practice and problem-solving. Theory-in-use showed a consistent fit with espoused theory, especially in relation to problem-solving, where 70\% of the consultants engaged in an approximate problem-solving cycle during the consultation. Outcomes are discussed in light of the literature on recommended practice in consultation. Limitations and suggested future directions for research are outlined.},

We suggest that each challenge is best met by two different, complementary modes of investigation. In the first (exploratory investigation), researchers should aim at generating robust pathophysiological theories of disease. In the second (confirmatory investigation), researchers should aim at demonstrating strong and reproducible treatment effects in relevant animal models. Each mode entails different study designs, confronts different validity threats, and supports different kinds of inferences. Research policies should seek to disentangle the two modes and leverage their complementarity. In particular, policies should discourage the common use of exploratory studies to support confirmatory inferences, promote a greater volume of confirmatory investigation, and customize design and reporting guidelines for each mode.},

First, we discuss some key conceptual issues and areas of potential controversy surrounding the content and organization of the Procedural and Coding Manual. Second, we discuss our research framework for coding evidence-based interventions (EBIs), taking into account the dimensional classification approach adopted by the Task Force on Evidence-Based Interventions in School Psychology. We contrast this coding scheme with the approach embraced by the Committee on Science and Practice of the Society of Clinical Psychology, Division 12, American Psychological Association. Third, we present our methodological framework for reviewing EBIs, including quantitative group-based and single-participant designs, qualitative research designs, and theory-guided confirmatory program evaluation models. Finally, we introduce the concept of a coding system to be implemented by practitioners to develop a knowledge base on what works in practice and help bridge the gap between research and practice.

Trhe present article reviews the current practice of school-based consultation in the UK, and discusses the degree to which current practice matches research findings on effective consultation from the UK and the USA. The article identifies some of the key characteristics which are essential for consultation to be effective in achieving change, and points out the need for such characteristics to underpin current approaches to consultation in the UK. While research findings have shown consultation to be a potentially effective approach to service delivery, a number of methodological shortcomings have been characteristic of research in this area, limiting the degree to which conclusions can be drawn. The article concludes with suggestions for future research and implications for school psychologists.},

The artefacts are further considered in terms of the levels of activity system that are operating. These are defined using Engestrom's notion of coordinated, cooperative and communicative systems. Findings suggest that the type of artefact used does vary between levels and that these can be predicted to a certain extent. This finding has relevance in terms of planning and structuring meetings in the future and in terms of enhancing the communicative potential of working practices.},

Two partially-traded local authority educational psychology services were recruited, one established and one emerging.

Participants from the established service included three educational psychologists, three small-scale service commissioners and two large-scale service commissioners. Focus groups, interviews and service brochures provided qualitative data. All qualitative data were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics to describe trends in service use.

We present new evidence that analyzing ordinal data as metric is problematic. We demonstrate that treating ordinal data as metric can yield low correct detection rates, distorted effect size estimates, and greatly inflated false alarm rates. Moreover, we demonstrate that the averaging of multiple ordinal items into a Likert scale does not solve these problems. We provide examples of real data in the contexts of the difference of two groups and simple linear regression. To solve these problems we use an ordered probit model with Bayesian estimation of parameters. The ordered probit model shows appropriate correct detection rates and false alarm rates, and produces accurate effect sizes estimates and response probabilities. Bayesian estimation of this ordinal model is straight forward, yields rich and accurate information, and has no need for auxiliary sampling assumptions. We conclude that ordinal data ought to be analyzed with ordinal models, and that Bayesian estimation is an excellent method for accomplishing that goal.},

Two models in particular, the proportional odds and the proportional hazards models are likely to be most useful in practice because of the simplicity of their interpretation. These linear models are shown to be multivariate extensions of generalized linear models. Extensions to non-linear models are discussed and it is shown that even here the method of iteratively reweighted least squares converges to the maximum likelihood estimate, a property which greatly simplifies the necessary computation.

The research provided a rich description of a range of discursive strategies employed by EPs during consultation. Strategies included EP directed collaboration, demonstrating empathy, summarising and reformulating. Using positioning theory allowed further exploration of the dynamics of consultation as a social event.

In general, both EPs and carers were enthusiastic about the sessions, with carers reporting that they found it helpful to be able to discuss their concerns, receive practical advice, set goals and gain a new insight into their situation. These findings were supported by an increase in carers' feelings of confidence, and a decrease in their feelings of concern, following the sessions.

Within this context, this study reviewed 35 child and adolescent consultation outcomes studies published from 1986 to 1997. Meta-analytic techniques were used to compute effect sizes for different consultation models, client, consultee, and system variables, and age and gender of clients. Behavioral consultation produced large positive effects on clients (i.e., children) and consul-tees (i.e., parents, teachers), organizational development consultation yielded robust effects at the system level, while mental health consultation produced medium effects on consultees. Consultation was particularly effective with clients with externalized behavior problems and academic difficulties. Large effects were found on consultees' learning of new skills and techniques, the reduction of referrals for psychoeducational assessments, and the increased use of psychological services. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed for practitioners in schools and related settings.},

Thus, before engaging in QCA proper \textendash{} the formal, computer-run part of it \textendash{} `it is necessary to gain familiarity with the relevant theories, the relevant research literature and, most important of all , the relevant cases' (Ragin 1987, p. 121; emphasis is ours).

On the one hand, does QCArelate to a specific conception of `what is a case?' (Ragin and Becker 1992) or, alternatively, can researchers with different conceptions of what a case is fruitfully exploit QCA? On the ...},

In this new edition, the authors combine best practices in consultation and problem-solving for interventions that promote and support children's potential, teachers' educational mission, and family members' unique strengths.   Important features in this new edition include:     A step-by-step framework for developing and maintaining family/school partnerships takes readers from initial interviews through plan evaluation.   Chapters include discussion on core interpersonal skills, including building trust, managing conflict, and communicating effectively.   Practical strategies illustrate working with diverse families and school personnel, improving family competence, promoting joint responsibility, and achieving other collaborative goals.   Case studies demonstrate CBC as implemented in traditional school, Head Start, pediatric health, and response-to-intervention (RtI) contexts.   In-depth research review explains the efficacy of CBC.   The progressive model of Conjoint Behavioral Consultation has a great deal to offer school psychologists, special educators and other school-based professionals as well as mental health practitioners. In addition, its accessibility makes this volume a suitable graduate text or training manual for those planning to work with children and families in these growing fields.},

CBC is an indirect service delivery model that addresses concerns shared by teachers and parents about students. In the present study, the intervention was aimed at promoting positive school-related social-behavioral skills and strengthening teacher-parent relationships in rural schools. Participants were 267 students in grades K-3, their parents, and 152 teachers in 45 Midwest rural schools. Results revealed that, on average, improvement among students whose parents and teachers experienced CBC significantly outpaced that of control students in their teacher-reported school problems and observational measures of their inappropriate (off-task and motor activity) and appropriate (on-task and social interactions) classroom behavior. In addition, teacher responses indicated significantly different rates of improvement in their relationship with parents in favor of the CBC group. Finally, the teacher-parent relationship was found to partially mediate effects of CBC on several student outcomes. Unique contributions of this study, implications of findings for rural students, study limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed.},

On the one hand, speaker-related factors such as age and brain damage modulate TOT occurrence. On the other hand, word-related factors such as frequency of usage of a word, and how recently it has been used, also have an impact. TOTs are investigated either by experimental elicitation (providing speakers with definitions of rare words), or by asking speakers to record their spontaneously occurring TOTs. Speakers in TOT states have fragmentary information about the words they cannot retrieve: they know the meaning of the word, its grammatical features, its number of syllables and its beginning sound or letter above chance. The availability of this information has been interpreted in models of speech production as supporting a dual-stage word retrieval process: the first step characterized by the retrieval of meaning and syntax, the second characterized by the retrieval of form (i.e., the sound pattern of the word). TOTs would arise as failures to complete the second step. TOTs have also been used as a tool to gain insight into meta-cognition (i.e., knowledge about one's own cognition).},

Part II focuses on research methods to understand how buildings and spaces work: observing behavior and the physical environment, asking questions in interviews and surveys, and employing archival records that include data and physical plans. 50 illustrations},

  abstract = {This book is a comprehensive guide to qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) using R. Using Boolean algebra to implement principles of comparison used by scholars engaged in the qualitative study of macro social phenomena, QCA acts as a bridge between the quantitative and the qualitative traditions. The QCA package for R, created by the author, facilitates QCA within a graphical user interface. This book provides the most current information on the latest version of the QCA package, which combines written commands with a cross-platform interface. Beginning with a brief introduction to the concept of QCA, this book moves from theory to calibration, from analysis to factorization, and hits on all the key areas of QCA in between. Chapters one through three are introductory, familiarizing the reader with R, the QCA package, and elementary set theory. The next few chapters introduce important applications of the package beginning with calibration, analysis of necessity, analysis of sufficiency, parameters of fit, negation and factorization, and the construction of Venn diagrams. The book concludes with extensions to the classical package, including temporal applications and panel data. Providing a practical introduction to an increasingly important research tool for the social sciences, this book will be indispensable for students, scholars, and practitioners interested in conducting qualitative research in political science, sociology, business and management, and evaluation studies.},

The QCAGUI package (the companion of the standard QCA package) is based on the Rcmdr user interface. Other, more advanced software exists that perform QCA algorithms but none of them offers the kind of development R has in terms of code readability, code sharing and helpful advice from a wide community. An R package for QCA emerges and its development is just beginning as the level of interest in R increases constantly.},

  abstract = {In this innovative approach to the practice of social science, Charles Ragin explores the use of fuzzy sets to bridge the divide between quantitative and qualitative methods. Paradoxically, the fuzzy set is a powerful tool because it replaces an unwieldy, "fuzzy" instrument\textemdash the variable, which establishes only the positions of cases relative to each other, with a precise one\textemdash degree of membership in a well-defined set.  Ragin argues that fuzzy sets allow a far richer dialogue between ideas and evidence in social research than previously possible. They let quantitative researchers abandon "homogenizing assumptions" about cases and causes, they extend diversity-oriented research strategies, and they provide a powerful connection between theory and data analysis. Most important, fuzzy sets can be carefully tailored to fit evolving theoretical concepts, sharpening quantitative tools with in-depth knowledge gained through qualitative, case-oriented inquiry. This book will revolutionize research methods not only in sociology, political science, and anthropology but in any field of inquiry dealing with complex patterns of causation.},

Rationales for listening to children include (1) supporting their rights to express views, (2) therapeutic benefits of participation, and either (3) valuing their views as insightful contributions to problem-solving or (4) considering them as contributory factors to the problem. This creates dilemmas about interpretation on different occasions, and a range of theoretical stances are discussed in terms of how far they can support robust decision-making about this interpretation, and a practical way forward is suggested using principles based on critical realism.},

  abstract = {Many studies have focused on the importance of the participation of children and young people (CYP) in their education, although fewer papers discuss the practical aspects of seeking their views and fewer again on representing them. A mixed method approach was used to collect information regarding educational psychologists' (EPs') practice in obtaining and representing CYP's views. A questionnaire (n = 73) was used to gather data from local authority educational psychology services (EPSs) across Wales and eight participants who completed the questionnaire took part in an interview to explore their views in more depth. Using thematic analysis, the major themes constructed included ``accessing a true representation of CYP's views'', ``gaining CYP's views empowers them'' and ``child-centred practice''. The implications of the present study for the role of educational psychologists are discussed, together with future directions for research and the limitations of the present study.},

There is pressure from professionals in education to extend these rights to all children. This article refers to recent legislation, with respect to the `voice of the child', and explores some of the theories and issues concerning listening to children. Recent initiatives in schools and the perceived benefits of involving pupils are reviewed. It is argued that educational psychologists (EPs) are in a position to facilitate greater involvement for pupils. Ways to promote this in EP practice are considered.},
