  abstract = {In this innovative approach to the practice of social science, Charles Ragin explores the use of fuzzy sets to bridge the divide between quantitative and qualitative methods. Paradoxically, the fuzzy set is a powerful tool because it replaces an unwieldy, {"}fuzzy{"} instrumentâ€”the variable, which establishes only the positions of cases relative to each other, with a precise oneâ€”degree of membership in a well-defined set.  Ragin argues that fuzzy sets allow a far richer dialogue between ideas and evidence in social research than previously possible. They let quantitative researchers abandon {"}homogenizing assumptions{"} about cases and causes, they extend diversity-oriented research strategies, and they provide a powerful connection between theory and data analysis. Most important, fuzzy sets can be carefully tailored to fit evolving theoretical concepts, sharpening quantitative tools with in-depth knowledge gained through qualitative, case-oriented inquiry. This book will revolutionize research methods not only in sociology, political science, and anthropology but in any field of inquiry dealing with complex patterns of causation.},

  abstract = {Although performing all available function directly from R's command line is possible, many users have expressed their desire for a user-friendly version of the QCA package with menus. Instead of designing the user interface from scratch it was a lot easier to use existing code and Rcmdr is the best engineered interface available for R. The QCAGUI package (the companion of the standard QCA package) is based on the Rcmdr user interface. Other, more advanced software exists that perform QCA algorithms but none of them offers the kind of development R has in terms of code readability, code sharing and helpful advice from a wide community. An R package for QCA emerges and its development is just beginning as the level of interest in R increases constantly.},

  abstract = {A QCA which uses only binary-value crisp-set data is referred to as a crisp-set QCA (csQCA). In this chapter, the findings of Krookâ€™s (2010) csQCA study on womenâ€™s representation in national parliaments are replicated. We first show how to calibrate crisp sets from categorical and continuous base variables, using both external criteria as suggested by theoretical knowledge and internal criteria as arrived at through empirical data analysis. We then proceed to the testing of necessity relations. The analysis of sufficiency relations is the next step, including the derivation of complex, parsimonious and intermediate solutions. Finally, we also demonstrate how to plot results for both types of relation as Venn diagrams.},
