  abstract = {Although literature is available on the theoretical models of consultation underpinning service delivery in educational psychology services, little research has been published on the application of these models to educational psychologist (EP) consultation practice with teachers in schools. This study explores the espoused theory of consultations of ten EP consultants, their theory-in-use and the degree to which there is a match or mis-match between the two. Ten EPs completed a pre-consultation questionnaire and audio-taped at least one initial teacher consultation, generating 17 case studies. The contents of the questionnaires and consultation transcripts were analysed using WinMax qualitative data analysis software. The analysis indicated that consultants' espoused theories were based on three models: solution-focused thinking, systemic practice and problem-solving. Theory-in-use showed a consistent fit with espoused theory, especially in relation to problem-solving, where 70\% of the consultants engaged in an approximate problem-solving cycle during the consultation. Outcomes are discussed in light of the literature on recommended practice in consultation. Limitations and suggested future directions for research are outlined.},

  abstract = {Research and recent policy developments in Eire highlight that there is a growing number of children in Irish schools presenting with special educational needs, leading to an increased need for Educational Psychology services. This research utilised case studies of children who were presenting to teachers with academic, social, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Semi-structured interviews were used to explore the perceived effectiveness of consultation as a model of delivery for Educational Psychologists (EPs). Each case comprised a teacher, parent and psychologist, (n = 9) from three different case studies. This research found potential benefits of consultation particularly for children and parents, although the results from this study are difficult to generalise, given the small sample size. This study has practical implications for EPs: by understanding parents' and teachers' perspectives this can help EPs in future planning for consultation. Further research should explore children's perceptions of consultation.},

Implications for practice, training, and research are discussed.},

  abstract = {The results of a large-scale randomized controlled trial of Conjoint Behavioral Consultation (CBC) on student outcomes and teacher-parent relationships in rural schools are presented. CBC is an indirect service delivery model that addresses concerns shared by teachers and parents about students. In the present study, the intervention was aimed at promoting positive school-related social-behavioral skills and strengthening teacher-parent relationships in rural schools. Participants were 267 students in grades K-3, their parents, and 152 teachers in 45 Midwest rural schools. Results revealed that, on average, improvement among students whose parents and teachers experienced CBC significantly outpaced that of control students in their teacher-reported school problems and observational measures of their inappropriate (off-task and motor activity) and appropriate (on-task and social interactions) classroom behavior. In addition, teacher responses indicated significantly different rates of improvement in their relationship with parents in favor of the CBC group. Finally, the teacher-parent relationship was found to partially mediate effects of CBC on several student outcomes. Unique contributions of this study, implications of findings for rural students, study limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed.},

Trhe present article reviews the current practice of school-based consultation in the UK, and discusses the degree to which current practice matches research findings on effective consultation from the UK and the USA. The article identifies some of the key characteristics which are essential for consultation to be effective in achieving change, and points out the need for such characteristics to underpin current approaches to consultation in the UK. While research findings have shown consultation to be a potentially effective approach to service delivery, a number of methodological shortcomings have been characteristic of research in this area, limiting the degree to which conclusions can be drawn. The article concludes with suggestions for future research and implications for school psychologists.},

First, we discuss some key conceptual issues and areas of potential controversy surrounding the content and organization of the Procedural and Coding Manual. Second, we discuss our research framework for coding evidence-based interventions (EBIs), taking into account the dimensional classification approach adopted by the Task Force on Evidence-Based Interventions in School Psychology. We contrast this coding scheme with the approach embraced by the Committee on Science and Practice of the Society of Clinical Psychology, Division 12, American Psychological Association. Third, we present our methodological framework for reviewing EBIs, including quantitative group-based and single-participant designs, qualitative research designs, and theory-guided confirmatory program evaluation models. Finally, we introduce the concept of a coding system to be implemented by practitioners to develop a knowledge base on what works in practice and help bridge the gap between research and practice.
