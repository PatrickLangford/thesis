DO I NEED TO DEFINE THE WORD 'FEATURE'?

# 1 Introduction 

This research consisted of interviews with Educational Psychologists (EPs), the development of a novel questionnaire, and observations of joint school-parent consultations with long-term follow-up. This was in service of exploring what the core features of consultation are, according to EP self-report and observation of real-world consultations, and how EPs altered their practice to adapt to the COVID-19 global pandemic. The interviews explored EP's definition of consultation, their views on what the key features of effective consultations are, what some of the barriers are, how they have changed their consultation practice as a result of the pandemic and the advantages and disadvantages of this. This was supplemented by a questionnaire which asked similar questions, as well as asking participants to identify the different kinds of work they were engaging in during the pandemic. The observation schedule was informed by the relevant literature and was used to see how often different features of consultation were observed during a joint school-parent consultation and in what order. This was then to be cross-referenced with reported progress towards jointly agreed goals for the child and young people (CYP) to see which features correlate with improved outcomes. This work built on a previous piece of research exploring what EPs believed were the most important features of consultation and a thematic analysis of recorded initial consultations to identify the main features in a live consultation.

## 1.1 Literature Review

A literature review was conducted to see what previous research had found to be the main features of consultation and what the main tools of analysing the efficacy of consultation were. Various databases, including Web of Science and Scopus, were searched using the key words “educational psychology” and “consultation”. Key references, such as @kennedy_educational_2008, were given to the researcher by their supervisor to set a baseline for the literature review. Considering all the relevant literature, there is some consistency around EPs views regarding consultation. However, there is a heterogeneity of understanding from other stakeholders as to what consultation actually means. Crucially, there is a relatively small amount of research exploring what happens during a consultation [@kennedy_educational_2008], as well as few studies evaluating the efficacy of consultation. There are also few studies which attempt to analyse what makes consultation effective or what the effective features of consultation are. This leaves EPs and associated stakeholders with a widely used but poorly understood and validated framework. 

### 1.1.1 What is consultation?

Consultation takes many different forms across contexts and countries. Consequently, there is not a universal definition of consultation as conducted by EPs. This raises an important problem for any EP who wishes to engage in consultation or analyse its efficacy. Within a western context, it fundamentally involves problem solving between consultants (EPs) and consultees. The consultee is most often a teacher who knows the CYP well, but it can also be parents and/or Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCOs). In joint school-family consultations, it is generally agreed prior to the consultation that at least one member from the child's family unit and the school will attend. These individuals collaborate to devise and establish interventions to help support and find solutions for the client, the CYP [@ofarrell_research_2018]. Consultation is considered a form of 'indirect’ work as the theory is that the EP can enact the most change for the CYP by meeting and working with those around the CYP [@gutkin_reconceptualizing_1990]. They may or may not engage one to one with the CYP but it is not mandated by this approach. 

Consultation has become the model of service delivery for many Educational Psychology Services [@sheridan_randomized_2017]. Most Educational Psychology Services (EPS) in the U.K. have moved towards a predominantly consultation-based service [@ofarrell_research_2018]. This is in contrast with what is viewed as a more traditional model which predominantly involves individual casework, typically including the administration of a cognitive assessment [@kratochwill_evidence_based_2002; @larney_school_based_2003]. The most commonly employed consultation framework in the U.K. is the Wagner model [@wagner_consultation_1995; @wagner_school_1995; @wagner_consultation_2000]. It is defined as “a voluntary, collaborative, non-supervisory approach, established to aid the functioning of a system and as inter-related systems” [@wagner_consultation_2000] through “purposeful [conversations] which [use] techniques of listening, clarifying, problem-solving, challenging, questioning and reflecting” [@munro_angles_2000]. As a result, EPs work with those closest to the CYP, but not as experts telling those directly involved with the CYP how to help them. Their role is to help empower the consultees to solve their own problems in school. The focus is not only on the CYP but their relations with others and the many different environments they are in, such as home, school, and their wider community [@bronfenbrenner_ecology_1981]. There is an understanding of the interactions between these layers and the need to consider a child holistically. This support is provided by asking questions, analysing presenting problems and helping others think differently, agreeing on potential interventions, and then reflecting on the whole process so progress can be made. 

### 1.1.2 How prevalent is consultation in the U.K.?

The move towards a consultation-based model of service is reflected in government legislation. The Special Education Needs: Code of Practice characterises consultation as one of the main services of EPs [@department_for_education_send_2015]. Several studies have also found it makes up a large percentage of their time working with schools. @shannon_educational_2007 delivered questionnaires to 44 EPs, asking for the EPs to self-report how often they undertook different types of work, including consultation or case work. 32 responded, with most reporting they spent a majority of their time engaging in individual level work. 91% of the EPs who were doing individual level work stated consultation was the main activity performed. However, the authors do not provide a definition of consultation nor ask the EPs to provide a definition of consultation. Given that consultation takes many different forms and there are a wide range of views on consultation between EPs and other stakeholders, ensuring everyone has the same definition of the process is crucial. Without it, one cannot be sure different EPs are engaging in consultation in a similar way and that the schools understand what they are doing. Participants may have reported they used consultation, but in practice their methods may be very different. Because of the limits of self report, we do not know if such a disparity exists in this study. On the other hand, the EPs who responded were from a large range of locations across the U.K., thus increasing the representativeness of the data. 

Another study exploring the prevalence of consultation in the UK comes from @leadbetter_patterns_2000. The authors sent questionnaires to all Principal Educational Psychologists (PEPs) and asked about their models of service delivery. Consultation was reported as one of the most frequently used models. However, there was only a return rate of 58%, with those not returning almost certainly not randomly distributed. There is therefore uncertainty around the amount of bias in the results. If the non-returns were randomly distributed on key variables, such as whether the EPs has recently experienced a number of organisational changes, then a low return rate would not introduce bias into the results. But this is unlikely. As such, the results of certain PEPs who may have different results from the norm are missing.

Although consultation forms the bedrock of many EPs work and the model of service delivery for EPS, EPs often struggle to articulate what a consultation model of service entails. @leadbetter_role_2004 argues there is little research which explicates the structure and process of consultation. This situation has not improved over the following years, with the few studies examining this typically only focusing on one EPS or a small number of EPs [@cording_study_2011; @leadbetter_investigating_2006; @pipher_consultation_2013]. These limitations prohibit one from developing a broad picture of how consultation is performed in the U.K.

### 1.1.3 What are consultees views on consultation?

Before exploring what occurs in a consultation, understanding what those involved (EPs, teachers) believe it to be is important. This is because if consultees are to play an active role in consultations (as all models of consultation state they should), their views of consultation need to be understood. That way, any misunderstandings can be cleared up and consultation can be effective. To serve this end, the following section explore stakeholders’ views of consultation as detailed in the relevant scientific literature. @ofarrell_research_2018 interviewed three groups containing a teacher, an EP, and the parents of the child the consultation was about. The teachers and parents reported that wile they appreciated and saw the value of consultation, there was a lack of understanding regarding its process and nature. All three teachers implied they viewed the EP as the external expert, who had specialist knowledge and access to resources which they wanted. This is in direct contrast to the sentiments expressed by the EPs in this study. They explicitly stated they were not experts and tried to distance themselves from that sentiment. This concept is fundamental to many models of consultation, including Wagner’s. This research was conducted in the Republic of Ireland. Here, consultation has only become the dominant model of service delivery in recent years. Thus, U.K. based teachers and SENCOs may have a better understanding. However, few pieces of research have been conducted to explore understanding of this important strand of EP work.

@dennis_so_2004 interviewed SENCOs at twelve schools to better understand their views on EP work. One of the core themes raised by the participants was a wish for EPS’s to “publicise more the range of things it has to offer and good/innovative practice”. The exact number of schools which held this belief is unknown as that information was not reported in the paper. Regarding consultation, there was a large heterogeneity in the the school's understanding of it. Some schools were fully aware of the consultation model of service delivery and preferred it to previous models. Such models focused on direct work, including assessment of CYP using cognitive assessments. However, other schools, either did not understand the consultation model or were only partially aware of it but preferred other models which placed a primacy on child-focused individual work. They reported they believed the consultation model involved “too much talk, not enough action” [@dennis_so_2004, 22] and thus did not value it as highly.  

This lack of understanding of consultation is found in other countries as well. Many Australian EPSs have also shifted their focus from an assessment-based to a consultation-based model of service delivery. But they also experience a lack of cohesion in understanding among stakeholders regarding the meaning and process of consultation [@bell_perceptions_2013]. However, some EPs do not report this problem. In the U.S.A., those who work with school psychologists (as EPs are called) show a greater consistency of understanding of consultation in schools. There is also a larger evidence base for the efficacy of their form of consultation. This is because consultation as practised in the U.S.A. is almost exclusively Conjoint Behavioural Consultation (CBC). CBC is defined as “a strength-based, cross-system problem-solving and decision-making model wherein parents, teachers, and other caregivers or service providers work as partners and share responsibility for promoting positive and consistent outcomes related to a child’s academic, behavioural, and social–emotional development” [@sheridan_conjoint_2007, p.25]. CBC has been shown to be effective for CYP over a wide range of settings and for many presenting problems [@sheridan_randomized_2017]. This hegemony of practice allows for a consistent definition and implementation, and is likely one of the reasons consultation in the U.S.A. is better understood and valued by stakeholders [@reddy_clinical_2000]. It also means its efficacy can be assessed more readily, such as by conducting a randomised control trial conducted by @sheridan_randomized_2012.

However, the lack of understanding by key stakeholders (SENCOs, teachers, and parents) may not truly reflect the modern day conception of consultation in the U.K. The research reporting these findings are roughly 15 years old. It is reasonable to presume stakeholders have become more familiar with it, given how prevalent it is. A more recent paper exploring this is @cording_study_2011. For this work, the authors interviewed 10 school personnel (such as Head teachers and teachers) and 9 EPs in a Welsh Local Authority (LA). The aim was to elicit their understanding of the kinds of work they believed EPs engage in. There was a general alignment between the views of the school personnel and the EPs themselves. But the school personnel stated they greatly valued the EP's expertise in diagnosing and alleviating presenting problems. This shows that despite there being a shared understanding of what EPs do, there is still a divide in what stakeholders value about EP work.

### 1.1.4 What are consultant’s views on consultation?

The vast majority of EPs have a positive view of consultation, with the Local Offer literature from many EPS stating their model of service delivery is consultation, such as Kensington & Chelsea [@royal_borough_of_kensington_&_chelsea_educational_2019]. Some EPs believe they provide a unique method of working through their use of consultation [@ashton_what_2006]. @ashton_what_2006 sent questionnaires to both schools and EPs asking for them to comment on the work EPs engage in. 22 questionnaires (out of 58) were returned from mainstream primary schools and eight (out of nine) EPs completed the questionnaire. ‘Statutory assessment work’, ‘Closed tests’ and ‘Expert role’ were the most frequently provided parts of EP work that were classed as unique by SENCOs. Few or no other agencies were judged by SENCOs as providing a similar or the same service as EPs. ‘Individual assessment and intervention’ and ‘Consultation’ were the aspects of EP work the EPs themselves believed were unique to them, as no other service provided these. This shows a clear disparity between the views of EPs and key stakeholders within consultation (SENCOs). They also reported that SENCOs typically valued more traditional EP work, such as individual assessment and giving advice. The SENCOs did not value consultation, nor give evidence they had a complete understanding of it.  However, these results should be interpreted with caution. The small sample limited to one LA undermines our ability to generalise the results to a wider context. It also only collected data from mainstream primary schools, further limiting the scope of these results. Yet one of the main results, namely the lack of understanding regarding the nature of consultation) has been replicated by research in other school settings [@dennis_so_2004; @ofarrell_research_2018].

### 1.1.5 What are the main features of consultation?

Once a common understanding of what the stakeholders believe consultation to be has been created, an analysis of the common features of consultation can occur. The following section will evaluate the relevant literature regarding the features of consultation. @henderson_exploration_2013 used focus groups with clusters of SENCos across a small LA to gain an understanding of their beliefs about the mechanics of consultation. The researchers sat in on five different Primary SENCo Network meetings and worked to elucidate their views. They presented the participants with statements about parts of the consultation process. Their task was to sort them depending on how often they believed the statements to be a part of a consultation. The mostly commonly given features of consultation were: discussing issues with relevant parties; information gathering; and it being a reflexive process with a focus on collaboratively crafting solutions. They also conducted semi-structured interviews with EPs, children who were receiving EP involvement, and their parents. It being a collaborative and problem-solving process, with a focus on solutions, and the development of positive working relationships between those involved were the two main themes. The use of focus groups to identify SENCO beliefs regarding the nature of consultation and the interviews with the stakeholders allows comparison between the stakeholder’s expectations and the reality of consultation. However, given the researchers did not directly observe consultations but relied on self-report, the conclusions that can be drawn regarding how consultations occur are weakened. This is because of the disparity between self-reports of behaviour and real-world instances of behaviour [@argyris_theory_1992].

@kennedy_educational_2008 thematically analysed the voice recordings of 17 EP-teacher consultations. These individual case studies [@robson_real_2015] were supplemented by a pre-consultation questionnaire completed by EPs to establish their espoused theory for consultation. A comparison could then be made between the recordings and participants' self-report to see whether their espoused theory aligned with the recorded behaviours. The authors report a high correspondence between the EPs espoused theory and theory in practice as EPs predominantly engaged in behaviours dictated by their espoused theory. The most common behaviours by EPs were working collaboratively, typically with those most involved (predominantly parents) using either Solution-Focused approaches or problem-solving analysis. Solution-Focused approaches are characterised by greater interest in the solutions to presenting problems rather than the problem itself. It views the client as capable of solving their own problems with a changed mindset, facilitated by the EP, through identifying times when the severity of the problem is reduced or it is not present, termed ‘exceptions’ [@rhodes_solution_2004]. Problem-solving analysis is related to behavioural consultation [@bergan_behavioral_1990] and is divided into four stages: problem identification, problem analysis, treatment implementation, and treatment evaluation [@sheridan_school_2000]. Those involved with the young person, such as teachers, are involved throughout [@kennedy_effective_2009]. By recording the consultations, the authors could gather data from a larger number of consultations than they could have if they sat in on every consultation. However, there was a low granularity of analysis. The researchers only assessed whether features of the espoused theory appeared at all during the consultation. Thus, the analysis only shows that during a consultation, EPs brought in ideas from their espoused theory at least once. There was no analysis of how frequently the ideas appeared and when during the consultations. It therefore cannot tell us how great a part these concepts from the espoused theory played in the consultation, merely that they were present.

@nolan_process_2014 observed seven consultations between five EPs, a teacher, and at least one parent. A week later, the researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with all EPs and teachers and some of the parents. Several key themes arose from the observations and interviews. These were: empowering those involved in the consultation; working collaboratively; the importance of each participant in the consultation recognising the valuable knowledge from others; reviewing outcomes; and EPs using their expertise to support others (without emphasising their role as the “expert”). The use of both observation and interview generates a lot of data about these 7 consultations, giving a very detailed understanding of the process. It also allows corroboration between data collection methods. However, the small sample size limits the generalisability of the findings. These results therefore need to be replicated with different configurations of participants and in other school settings.

@ofarrell_research_2018 found teachers appreciated consultation as they felt empowered to support the pupils who had been referred. According to @jones_refocusing_1990, this empowering of consultees rather than fixing the consultees problems or simply giving advice, is part of the definition of consultation. @dennis_so_2004 found that EPs and SENCOs saw several key issues relating to the successful implementation of a consultation model: the EP having a detailed knowledge of the system (school) they were working in; addressing issues at multiple levels (rather than just on the individual level); positive relationships between the EP and SENCO; and empowering staff to successfully fix their problems, rather than doing it for them.

@dickinson_consultation_2000 & @munro_angles_2000 examined how consultation had been implemented in their EPS (Lincolnshire and Buckinghamshire respectively). Behaviours and approaches which helped support the successful implementation of consultation across both EPS’s included: having purposeful conversations; EPs using their psychological knowledge during consultations; and all parties involved deciding on interventions as well as reviewing past and current interventions. Factors that were only reported in @munro_angles_2000 included: engaging in preventative work; improving outcomes; and engaging in multi-level collaborative work. Unfortunately, these papers are based on the author's reflections on the implementation of consultation in their LA and do not give the views of anyone else or provide much in the way of data to support their findings. Readers must therefore take them at their word.

This research builds on a previous piece of work by the lead researcher. This first work explored what EPs believe the key features of a consultation are and what happened in an initial consultation between at least an EP and a school staff member. This was done through a novel questionnaire asking EPs to rank features of consultation according to their importance and thematically analysing transcripts of consultations. During the consultations, the two most frequent features of consultation were 'Understanding the presenting problem' and 'Working together to come up with solutions'. EPs rated these as core features of consultation in the questionnaire, as well as improving outcomes for young people. Whilst this research assessed what EPs believe the core features are and what the features are of an initial consultation, the small sample size (3 observed consultations and 8 EPs completing the questionnaire) means the results are hard to generalise beyond the immediate consultations. 

Although these studies typically only focused on a small number of participants, the consistency in results allows fundamental features of consultation to be gleaned. The studies also cover a wide range of EPS, so the results are not limited to a specific region. This increases the generalisability of the findings. However, despite these consistencies, there is still a great deal of heterogeneity in consultation models and practice. EPs can state they are engaging in consultation, but without more information or a previously established working relationship, those involved (parents, teachers, etc.) are unlikely to know what to expect with a consultation. An arguably more serious consequence is that assessing the efficacy of consultation is very difficult. If consultations are not ergodic due to the very wide range of features, any assessment of consultation may not be valid for consultations performed by an individual EP. Therefore, assessing the efficacy of consultations is difficult. This is against the backdrop of EPs working within ‘traded services’ [@lee_exploration_2017], where the ability to demonstrate efficacy is highly valued. It therefore behoves EPs to gain an understanding of the consistent features of consultation. This will allow some assessment of which features are correlated with improved outcomes for CYP.

### 1.1.6 Assessing the efficacy of consultation

There have been calls for assessing the efficacy of EP work for decades, such as @cline_quality_1994, but this has become even more important since the almost complete shift to 'traded services' [@national_college_for_teaching_and_leadership_educational_2014]. 'Traded services' marks a shift in funding towards existing service organisations needing to generate income from schools (seen as customers) to either partially or fully financially support itself [@woods_preparation_2014]. Many EPs feel a pressure from schools to both provide something tangible for customers and to demonstrate the effectiveness of their work, so schools buy their services again [@lee_exploration_2017]. EPs are also expected to use evidence-based tools and to critically evaluate their practice [@british_psychological_society_quality_2015, Standard 4.8; @health__care_professions_council_standards_2015, Standard 12.1] as part of the requirements of practising as an EP. It is therefore very important for EPs to understand what aspects of consultation are effective in eliciting change. 

Measuring such change is difficult. As @kennedy_educational_2008 notes, due to the complex nature of the interactions between consultant, consultee, and client it is difficult to decide what to measure and how to do so. Several methods have been put forward but none have gained ascendancy yet. One method used by some EPS [@hampshire_eps_how_2010] is the Target Monitoring Evaluation [@dunsmuir_evidencebased_2009]. Target Monitoring Evaluation (TME) is based on Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS), which was developed by @kiresuk_goal_1968 to evaluate the outcomes of mental health interventions. TME is a streamlined form of GAS, with the added advantage of increased granularity in evaluating progress in relation to expected progress. TME involves the negotiated development of SMART goals (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time limited) between the EP and the consultees. TME forms were completed by both EPs at two Local Authorities and assistant EPs in one County. During the initial consultation, after the goals had been decided upon, each participant rated how far along on a 10-point scale the child currently was towards each goal. They then stated how far they expected the child to be when they had their review consultation. 6-8 weeks later, during the review consultation, each participant rated how far the child had actually progressed, which was compared with how far they were predicted to progress. Interviews were conducted with teachers, SENCOs, and headteachers, who gave positive feedback on the easy and efficiency of the process, as well as how the tool helped focus on setting of targets. Two of those interviewed had experience with GAS and stated they preferred TME. Focus groups of EPs and assistant EPs elicited positive views towards the tool, as well as considerations of implementation. 

This pilot study gives evidence for TMEs efficacy in assessing progress in response to EP intervention. However, the limited detail provided in the report means we do not have a fine grained understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the tool. @monsen_evaluation_2009 assessed the efficacy of assistant EPs using TME and focus groups with stakeholders. Both measures found assistant EPs to be beneficial to EP work. This work was conducted in one EPS, therefore the generalisability of the findings are limited. TME is a quantitative assessment of efficacy and the focus groups produced qualitative data, comparison of efficacy between the two measures is difficult. We therefore cannot draw strong conclusions about the validity of TME when assessing educational psychology work. 

There have been a few studies which have attempted to compare TME with other quantitative measures of change, such as @connor_target_2010. In this thesis, the author compared TME with other, more established forms of progress measurement in domains like reading, such as the York Assessment of Reading Comprehension (YARC). They report that there was broad agreement between the TME and other forms of assessment; when other forms of assessment found improvement, this was reflected in the reported change through the TME forms. However, while TME may be useful for identifying progress in individual children, it was not clear how it could be used to assess the quality of the work from the EP. There were also some difficulties regarding the use of it, as there was disagreement between some consultants and consultees regarding target setting and the voice of the child. 

A recent paper [@eddleston_using_2018] comparing different consultation evaluation tools excluded TME because it did not reach the inclusion criteria. Here, TME’s streamlined nature counted against it as it was not sufficiently thorough enough to be evaluated. This means there is limited evidence for its efficacy as a tool. However, as @dunsmuir_evidencebased_2009 states, “the strengths of GAS are maintained but the TME system is more streamlined and user friendly” (p 67). We can therefore have increased confidence in the validity of TME as a measure of change, given that GAS has been shown to be a useful tool [@roach_goal_2005] and it shares fundamental similarities.

### 1.1.7 Local Offer literature 

To gain an understanding of what EPs at different LAs understood consultation to be, the Local Offer literature was examined. This information was found on the LA’s websites and detailed what services the EPS provided. Despite almost all services having moved to a consultation-based service delivery [@dinkmeyer_consultation_2016], over a third of LAs did not explicitly mention consultation. Of those that did, the most commonly cited feature was working with relevant parties, such as teachers. The second most common was improving outcomes for the CYP, with the importance of looking for solutions (including the use of Solution-Focused approaches) also being mentioned frequently. What this shows is that for the LAs that mention it, the EPs working there have explicitly stated the importance of collaborating with those closest to the CYP and the necessity of improving the CYP’s outcomes.

## 1.2 Context and rationale

This project was greatly shaped by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the subsequent response by the British Government. Because of this, the research was conducted during unprecedented circumstances. All EPs (and workers in general) had to work remotely from home. This presented unique concerns for how EPs worked, as they were not allowed to see any adults or CYP in person. Several documents, such as @bhardwaj_rapid_2020, and one piece of research [@aep_survey_2020] were disseminated drain this time, detailing guidance as to how EPs can work ethically within the context of a lockdown. This included conducting consultations using either phones or video call software, such as Microsoft Teams or Zoom. There were concerns regarding the safety and privacy of Zoom technology [@paul_zoom_2020] so Teams was encouraged by many EPS. This shifted the manner in which the research could be conducted: consultations could not be observed in person and many EPs were not engaging in consultation. The timeline of the research was changed as a result, with the observation of consultations pushed back to September 2020 when it was hoped they would resume by. There was also a broadening of the parameters of the research. Questions exploring the impact of the lockdown were posed to interviewees and a questionnaire was designed and disseminated to explore a wide range of views towards consultation and how it had been affected by the pandemic.

The purpose of this research was it gain an insight into what happens during a joint school-family consultation, as well as which features correlate with rated changes towards agreed goals. Having a more fine-grained understanding of when different feature are seen and how frequently would provide valuable insight into what are the core feature of a consultation. This could then be cross-referenced with the ratings of progress as measured by TME. Because of the global pandemic, a related question was explored regarding the use of technology when conducting consultations. Gaining an understanding of what the core features of consultation is allows EPs to understand what is essential for a consultation to occur. This will inform the professions response to the lockdown, subsequent lockdowns, and EP work in general. EP beliefs regarding how consultation can be performed and their experiences changing their work can give guidance as to how EPs should use consultation in future, beyond the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemics. 

## 1.3 Research questions

Given the lack of strong theory in this area of research, research questions were developed but statistical hypotheses could not be drawn. Thus, it is exploratory research [@kimmelman_distinguishing_2014]. The research questions are:

1. What do EPs believe are the core features of a joint school-parent consultation?

2. Which features of consultation correlate with increased progress towards agreed goals?

# 2 Methodology

## 2.1 Epistemology and research paradigm

To explore these questions, a mixed methodology was employed, making use of quantitative and qualitative research methods. It was informed by a scientific realism epistemology. Scientific realism can help approach difficult problems in social science as it takes into account the complexity of the situation in which they occur [@house_realism_1991]. It can be viewed as a pragmatic approach [@robson_real_2015] as it is less concerned with philosophical dualisms, such as rationalism versus empiricism, and more with practical considerations of issues and potential solutions [@johnson_mixed_2004]. Mixed methodology aligns with a pragmatic approach as it is not beholden to one method of exploring a research topic; it sees the benefits of both for exploring a research question in different ways [@denscombe_communities_2008]. Multiple methods of inquiry were employed because it is generally believed using different means to explore research questions brings greater rigour [@creswell_research_2003]. Data can be triangulated with one another, with evidence corroborating, refuting, or adding nuance to each other and increasing confidence in ones findings [@munafo_robust_2018]. Mixed methodology research designs can be divided along a key dimension: paradigm emphasis [@johnson_mixed_2004]. This refers to whether one strand of the research (quantitative or qualitative) is given greater emphasis during analysis. Because equal weight was placed on both forms of inquiry, this was an 'equal weight' paradigm emphasis piece. An explicit account of the ways in which the qualitative and quantitative arms of the research relate to one another will be given [@denscombe_communities_2008].

## 2.2 Participants

Ethical approval was obtained from UCL the Institute of Education’s Ethical Committee. The inclusion criteria for all three arms of the research was: an EP or TEP who used consultation as part of their practice. There were no requirements as to how frequently or recently it had to be used, nor experience or location. Nor were there requirements around the definition of consultation; just that EPs believed themselves to be engaging in consultation. This was to try and elicit a wide a range of views on consultations from practising EPs. For the interview and observation, participants were recruited via the researcher's EPS. Convenience sampling was therefore used. This was because participant recruitment for the observation was judged to be difficult and the researcher would have greater success by asking participants they already had a professional relationship with. The interview also recruited participants by sharing a call for participation on a popular mailing list for EPs and other education professionals (EPNET) and social media (Twitter). Participants were also asked to share the call for participants with other EPs at their work. This was the method used for recruiting participants to the questionnaire as well. Thus, a mixture of convenience and snowball sampling [@robson_real_2015] was employed for these two arms of the research.

### 2.3.1 Interviews

A semi-structured interview format was used because an interview schedule was developed (Appendix 1) which served as a checklist of areas to be explored with a given question order and wording. However, the order and wording was allowed to change given the flow of the interview. Additional questions were used to further develop a interviewee's answer [@robson_real_2015]. The interviews were of the focused type as the questions centred around the key theme of consultation [@merton_focused_1990]. Probes (interview devices to elicit more information) were employed by the researcher to further develop the interviewee's responses. To achieve this, 'laddering questions' (questions phrased in a variety of ways asking for the interviewee to expand on their answer) and 'summarising techniques' (summarising what has just been said by the interviewee to prompt more information), as well as 'addition probes' to maintain the flow of the conversation [@zeisel_inquiry_2006]. All interviews were recorded with an Honor 10 lite phone. The anonymous transcript was thematically analysed using the software NVivo .

### 2.3.2 Observation

The quantitative arm of the research involved systematic observations of joint home-school consultations with an EP. Thus, it was a naturalistic observation as the participants were observed in their typical environment without any interference from the researcher [@vigliocco_tip_tongue_2001]. A systematic observation was chosen as it helps overcome the often recorded discrepancy between what people say they do and how they behave in the real-world. This has been reported in such wide-ranging fields as smartphone use [@andrews_beyond_2015] to driving behaviours [@kaye_comparison_2018]. They involve the development of a coding scheme (Appendix 2) to identify categories over the course of a set period of time. The categories are defined and operationalised prior to data collection [@croll_systematic_1986]. They were derived from the relevant literature and were mutually exclusive. The categories were limited to what was explicitly said. Models of consultation, such as Solution-focused and problem-analysis, were broken down into their constituent observable parts, such as exploring strengths and identifying exceptions. Event sampling was used as the absolute and relative frequency of events was of interest [@robson_real_2015]. A sequence record was also used to provide information as to the order in which the features were seen, thus providing information about transitions [@robson_real_2015]. Time sampling was not chosen so no events were missed because they fell outside of the time intervals. However, the length of time each feature occurred for was lost. Whilst this information would be valuable to see how long each feature lasted for, rather than just how frequently it occurred, it was decided that the risk of missing feature due to the researcher focusing on correctly marking the time of each feature outweighed the benefit of gaining that information.

To explore the relationship between the features and the change in the goals for each consultation, Qualitative Comparison Analysis (QCA) was used. It is characterised as a "small-N-many variables" approach. Configurational Comparative Methods: Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) and Related Techniques: "QCA techniques allow the systematic comparison of cases, with the help of formal tools and with a specific conception of cases."

"In the process of configurational comparative analysis, the researcher engages in a dialogue between cases and relevant theories. Indeed, the choice of the variables (conditions and outcome) for the analysis must be theoretically informed. In this sense, there is a deductive aspect to QCA; however, QCA techniques can also be used more inductively, gaining insights from case knowledge in order to identify the key “ingredients” to be considered (Rihoux, 2003, 2006; Rihoux & Lobe, 2009)."

"QCA techniques allow for “conjunctural causation” across observed cases. This means that different constellations of factors may lead to the same result (equifinality)"

"By using QCA, the researcher is urged not to specify a single causal model that best fits the data, as one usually does with statistical techniques, but instead to determine the number and character of the different causal models that exist among comparable cases (Ragin, 1987)."

for the statistical programming language R [@r_core_team_r_2017]

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1089061/pdf/hsresearch00022-0148.pdf: "to assess the sufficiency of a combination of causal conditions, the researcher selects cases with a given combination of conditions and then evaluates whether or not these cases display the same, or roughly the same, outcome." 


### 2.3.3 Questionnaire

A questionnaire was designed using Qualtrics to explore consultation as conducted both during the lockdown and prior to it. The questions were informed by the answers to the interview questions, as recommended by [@gehlbach_measure_2011]. Due to the fact the way answer options are presented can bias results [@schwarz_self_reports_1999], the construction of the question and answers was guided by the best practice recommendations from @gehlbach_measure_2011. Quantitative questions explored what the key features of consultation are (both before and during the lockdown), what kinds of work EPs engaged in (before and during the lockdown), how they have found the changes to their work (with Likert scale ratings), and how much different types of work have been affected by the lockdown. Questions suggesting different features of consultation were based on the scientific literature, for example @dennis_so_2004; @dickinson_consultation_2000; @farrell_developing_2006; @henderson_exploration_2013; @kennedy_educational_2008; @munro_angles_2000; & @nolan_process_2014, and the material on the Local Offer websites. These were the same features used in the observation schedule. Open-ended questions will be used to explore the changes to EP consultations as a result of the lockdown and their views towards technologically mediated consultations. This is because there is no published literature to suggest what EPs may experience, given the unprecedented nature of the present circumstances. It is therefore best to give participants the opportunity to respond how they wish, without a narrowing of options by the questionnaire.

## 2.4 Procedure

Prior to data collection, it was decided the quantitative arm would be conducted first, starting in March 2020 and continuing until March 2021. Interviews would be conducted in the autumn of 2020. Thus, a concurrent triangulation design would be employed [@creswell_research_2003]. Both the quantitative and qualitative arms of the research would be conducted simultaneously and independently. The results were to be compared to see whether the conclusions drawn align with one another. This was done for practical rather than philosophically informed reasons. It was agreed beforehand that collecting observation data would be more difficult, as finding consultations with all the required participants who were also willing to be observed is unlikely. Consultations with both the teacher and parent present are less likely to occur than consultations with just one of them, given the specific multiplication rule of probability [@grinstead_introduction_1997]. It was therefore felt that having a longer window of opportunity to collect data was the reasonable course of action.

However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic all in person consultations were cancelled across the U.K. to comply with the government-mandated lockdown [@cabinet_office_staying_2020]. Whilst many EPs offered consultations to their respective schools, most found they delivered far fewer consultations during the lockdown than usual. Those who delivered consultations typically did so via the phone, eliminating any chance of observation by the researcher. In response, data collection for the interviews was brought forward to start in March 2020 and observations of consultations would occur once consultations could be observed by the researcher. The research was therefore adapted to use a sequential transformative design [@creswell_research_2003]. This type of mixed methodology involves one method preceding the other. Either the qualitative or the quantitative arm of the research project is conducted first. The methodology does not require one be used before the other, so practical reasons may determine the order of research. The results from both strands are interpreted together, with one informing the other. 

### 2.4.1 Interviews

Interviews were originally planned to be in person with EPs in the researcher's EPS. However, because of the global pandemic, all non-essential in person meetings were banned. They were therefore switched to video or phone call interviews. Because of the sudden increase in proficiency and willingness of many EPs to use phone and video call technology, the parameters of the participant recruitment for the interviews was widened to all EPs. This decision was made because of a desire to increase the number of participants and thus the range of views on consultation. 

Semi-structured focused interviews were used to elicit EP views with regards to the core features of consultation, the barriers to effective consultation, how their consultation work has changed in response to the lockdown, and the advantages and disadvantages of this new way of working. 27 EPs were interviewed using a mixture of phone and video call technology. Data collection took place between 31/03/2020 and 28/05/2020. All interviews were recorded and an anonymous transcript made. These transcripts were thematically analysed, which involves the identification of themes through “careful reading and re-reading of the data” [@rice_qualitative_1999]. A mixed or hybrid thematic analysis approach [@fereday_demonstrating_2006] was employed. This incorporates inductive and deductive thematic analysis. Inductive thematic analysis is driven primarily by the data [@boyatzis_transforming_1998] and deductive thematic analysis is theory-driven with codes derived from said theory [@crabtree_template_1992]. The a priori codes identified were developed from the scientific and Local Offer literature. Semantic themes (that which is explicitly said) were found and analysed [@boyatzis_transforming_1998]. 

### 2.4.2 Observation

After gaining informed consent from all participants, the researcher observed the consultation unfold as normal. The researcher will use the observation schedule to mark when and how frequently different features occur. These will then be summed. Immediately after the conclusion of the consultation, each participant (EP, school staff member, and parent/guardian) was asked to collectively identify 2-3 goals for the CYP to work towards. This was done using a TME form. Participants rated, on a scale of 1-10, where the CYP currently was towards that goal (by writing the letter 'B' for 'baseline' next to the number) and where they expected them to be in 6-8 weeks (by writing the letter 'E' by the number). In 6-8 weeks time, participants would be contacted by the researcher via email to rate how far along the CYP had progressed towards that goal. This judgement was represented by the letter 'A' (for 'actual') along the same rating scale. This data will be summarised with the median ratings for each category ('baseline', 'expected', and 'actual') presented. The summed features would be tallied against the progress made for each observed consultation. This will be calculated by subtracting the 'baseline' rank from the 'actual' as research suggests most TME forms report a positive change as a result of the consultation [@dunsmuir_evidencebased_2009; @monsen_evaluation_2009]. Whilst the independent variable of frequency counts of features is continuous, the dependent variable of the reported progress is ordinal. Therefore, a Spearman rank-order correlation will be used [@field_discovering_2012] to measure the correlation between features of consultation and reported change in outcomes for the CYP.

### 2.4.3 Questionnaire
 
A questionnaire was designed to supplement the findings from the interviews. By identifying key ideas from the interview answers, these could be explored with a larger sample by using a questionnaire. Data collection took place between 26/05/2020 and 04/06/2020. Descriptive statistics of the types of features employed during consultations will be reported, along with how much of an impact the lockdown has had on different kinds of work and the changes made to work during the pandemic. The open text questions exploring participant views towards the use of technology when conducting consultations and how their work has been impacted by the lockdown were thematically analysed. Inductive thematic analysis was used to explore the semantic themes [@boyatzis_transforming_1998]. Inductive analysis is data driven and thus codes are derived from the data, rather than pre-determined codes being used to analyse the data [@guest_applied_2012]. The question assessing how much each type of work has been affected will be plotted to check the distribution of responses. Likert rating scales produce ordinal data and the responses are unlikely to be normally distributed, therefore models which assume normally distributed continuous data are inappropriate [@liddell_analyzing_2017]. It will therefore be analysed using a cumulative probit ordinal regression model [@burkner_ordinal_2019] to see if there differences between types of work as well as groups, such as role. A probit model will be used as the latent variable which the question is seeking to measure (how greatly various kinds of work have been affected by the lockdown) is assumed to be normally distributed [@mccullagh_regression_1980].

To see whether the lockdown has affected the prevalence of different features of consultation, a two-way within subjects ANOVA will be used. This is suitable because the data is proportional [@mangiafico_summary_2016]. The features will be clustered into subgroups: Solution-Focused, Problem analysis, Organisation and knowledge; and Valuing everyone (see Appendix 3 for a breakdown of the features into the subgroups). The subgroups will be analysed independently with the other factor (time) common to all subgroup analyses. Time will have two levels (before and during lockdown). Responses which did not include any data for questions relating to the features of consultation or how their work had been impacted by the pandemic were excluded. 

## 2.5 Reflections on pilot

### 2.5.1 Interview schedule

The interview was piloted with a Trainee Educational Psychologist (TEP) to check for flow and whether the interviewees understood the questions. The TEP commented on the definition of "features" in question 5. The word was changed to "features" and a clarification statement will be provided, along with a  definition if necessary.

### 2.5.2 Observation schedule

To establish inter-rater reliability (IRR), an anonymous transcript of a previously recorded consultation was analysed for feature using the observation schedule. Three raters, including the researcher, assessed the transcript for feature of consultations in their relative order. Intraclass correlations [@shrout_intraclass_1979] were calculated between the three raters. The relative frequency of each category was calculated for each rater and compared with one coder's (the researchers) results. Because frequency counts were used, intraclass correlations (ICC) were suitable as the data is continuous. To calculate ICC, four factors must be decided upon prior to calculation [@hallgren_computing_2012]. A two way model was used because the raters weren't randomly selected from the population. Given that a non-timed sequence record design was chosen for the observation schedule, good IRR was defined as consistency in the ratings because it was more important that raters provide scores that are similar in rank order. A single measures ICC was calculated because the reliability of the other two raters needed to generalise to ratings of one coder (the researcher). And finally, a mixed model was used because the raters were not randomly chosen from a population. This model was applied using the irr package [@gamer_irr_2019] in R. This produced an ICC of  0.471 which, according to guidelines provided by @Cicchetti1994 are ‘substantial’. 

The categories are defined and operationalised prior to data collection [@croll_systematic_1986]. They were derived from the relevant literature and were mutually exclusive. This was to increase the reliability as it reduces the chances of observations being coded differently according to the interpretation of an observer. To further reduce risks to reliability, the categories were limited to what was explicitly said. This was done to minimise the amount of inference the researcher had to use when deciding whether a category was observed [@croll_systematic_1986]. Models of consultation, such as Solution-focused, were broken down into their constituent observable parts, such as exploring strengths and identifying exceptions, so the categories were more fine-grained and which specific features of the models were used during consultations.

### 2.5.3 Questionnaire

14 TEPs piloted the questionnaire. They identified a few questions which could be misinterpreted ("What will you do differently when things go back to normal") and questions which would benefit from an explanation as to how the answering mechanic worked. They also identified additional types of work EPs could engage in during the lockdown. Overall the feedback was positive, with particular focus on the breadth of questions and the inclusion of changes to practice during the current lockdown. One TEP reported that questions 17 and 18 could be interpreted in different ways: do EPs think they should change their consultations compared with how they were conducted prior to the lockdown or how they are done now? Because the focus of the question is about what they will do differently as a result of their experiences, the question was changed to reflect this. A comment was raised about the order of the options when selecting the magnitude of the impact on different kinds of work due to the lockdown. It was decided it would be in ascending order as this makes more intuitive sense when reading from left to right.

# 3 Results

## 3.1 Interviews

29 EPs of varying roles and locations were interviewed. Participants included TEPs, maingrade EPs, specialist EPs, senior EPs, and Principal EPs from all over the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland. The results will be divided in two, according to the research question they relate to.

### 3.1.1 What do EPs believe are the core features of a joint school-parent consultation?

Preliminary thematic analysis of the questions relating to the features of consultation revealed common codes. Some of the most common explicitly identified features of consultation included: building a trusting relationship with the consultee(s); collaboration; exploring solutions; valuing everyone's contributions; and the EP moving away from an expert role. The most commonly named model of consultation was Solution-Focused. Using the deductively analysed codes, 'suggesting solutions', 'everyone's contributions being valued', and 'EPs using expert knowledge' were the most commonly coded features. However, every EP who stated they made use of their specialist knowledge explicitly stated they did not want to take an "expert role"; an external professional who came in to a situation and told everyone what to do and how to fix things. They emphasised the importance of creating a shared space to explore everyone's views and taking on board their ideas. 

Several of the other questions revealed what EPs believed were key features of consultations. Many EPs stated they felt they lost something with telephone or video call consultations (though certainly not all of them). They typically referenced an increase difficulty in picking up on subtle non-verbal cues and being able to develop a relationship with the consultee(s). This suggests face-to-face meetings are an important feature of consultations, as EPs believe they need them to help them effectively conduct a consultation. The most commonly given barriers to consultation included a lack of time, the school buying into the process and philosophy of consultation (including seeing its value), 

### 3.1.2 How do EPs use technology when engaging in consultation and what are their views towards it?

Preliminary thematic analysis of questions exploring EP views towards technologically mediated consultations highlighted several concepts. Most EPs stated they could see the value of using technology (telephone or video call tools) during a consultation. Some stated they would incorporate it into their practice once the lockdown had been lifted, although many still felt that in-person consultation was superior. This was because of the potential issues with technologically mediated consultations ranging from the banausic issue of connectivity problems to difficulties with rapport building. Given the importance almost every EP placed on building a positive relationship, this poses a problem for technologically mediated consultations. However, this sentiment was not universal. A few EPs stated they did not feel any loss of rapport quality when using technologically mediated consultations. One EP had been exclusively using phone consultations for almost a year prior to the lockdown at the request of the consultees (predominantly teachers). They reported that consultees preferred this method of consultation and both consultant and consultees felt able to develop a positive working relationship.

Several EPs stated they believed using technology broadened their access to some families and young people. If parents have difficulties attending the school, due to either busy work schedules or their own personal difficulties, contacting them when and where was more convenient for them increased participation rates. EPs also stated they could engage more with young people, as they could call them in the young person's home or room. As the young person was in a safe and familiar environment, they often felt more comfortable talking to the EP. Some EPs hypothesised the young people felt more comfortable speaking through a device because they are more familiar with this form of communication. Many EPs stated they appreciated not having to travel for consultations. This was especially true for EPs who had to spend hours travelling to and from schools. Most stated they felt this increase in wellbeing due to decreased travel times improved the quality of their work and relationships, as they had more time to think about each case.

Some of the issues highlighted with regards to using technologically mediated consultations included difficulties in understanding one another, especially when English was not a members first language. 

## 3.2 Questionnaire

68 EPs with a wide range of roles, including TEPs and Principal EPs, from all areas of the U.K. completed the questionnaire. Preliminary analysis of the data shows that joint school-parent consultations were one of the most frequently performed types of work prior to the lockdown, along with parent consultation, individual assessment, and training. Many stated they could no longer engage in most of their typical types of work, such as observation, individual assessment, and joint school-parent consultations. Most stated they found the changes 'very challenging'. A majority of respondents replaced face to face meetings with telephone calls and some replaced them with video calls. Some respondents stated they found it harder to elicit the views of CYP when working remotely.

### QCA

No pair-wise simplifications could be made as there were no consultations which saw change which differed by only 1 feature.
