# Abstract

Consultation is an integral part of many Educational Psychologist's
(EPs) work. Yet there is a large heterogeneity in understanding and use
of this tool. Such diversity makes evaluating its efficacy difficult.
This research therefore sought to identify what the effective features
of consultation are by linking observed features to changes in agreed
outcomes for children and young people (CYP). Mixed methods were
employed to explore what EPs believe are the key features of
consultation, what the barriers to effective consultation are, what
happens in a consultation for a child or young person, and what
combination of features can be identified in consultations which lead to
positive changes for CYP. 

To explore EP views towards the effective
features of consultation, 30 EPs were interviewed. Observable features
of consultation were tallied for six consultations. For those
consultations, goals were identified by participants and a baseline
rating was given for each goal using Target Monitoring Evaluation (TME)
forms. There were 10 goals identified. Change for these goals was
recorded through completing the same form 6-8 weeks later, to allow
analysis of which combination of features were present for children with
differing progress towards outcomes. This was assessed using Qualitative
Comparative Analysis (QCA). 

The most effective features of consultation,
as identified by EPs, included the expert knowledge EPs have, the
collaborative nature of consultation, and creating a shared
understanding of the CYP and context for all participants. Consultations
which were most likely to see positive change for CYP were ones in which
the consultation was not dominated by gaining an understanding of the
presenting problem. These results give clarity as to what the features
of an effective consultation are through a mixed methods analysis. The
findings have implications for EPs who use consultation, as well as
consultees and those whom consultations are for.

\newpage

# Impact statement

Consultation is a fundamental but understudied pillar of educational
psychologists (EPs) practice in the UK This research sought to
qualitatively and quantitatively identify the core features of a
consultation which helps produce change for the CYP with whom we work.
By taking a mixed methods approach, this complex question could be
analysed in a multitude of ways and through a range of methodologies. By
doing so, the scope and depth of the issue is more likely to be
understood. This can have a positive impact on both future research and
practicing EPs across the country by helping them identify what they
need to include in a consultation for it to be effective.

The data from this piece of research will be made publicly available, so
that other researchers can download and analyse the results. Whilst
thematic analysis (TA) was used, there are a wealth of methodologies
which could be used to analyse the interview transcripts. There is also
a range of research questions which can be explored using this data,
thus allowing the research to have greater academic impact beyond this
thesis.

As this is the first example of QCA within educational psychology
research, this thesis serves as an introduction to this methodology. It
will hopefully encourage other researchers to use this tool in the
exploration of the causal relationship between combinations of causes
and outcomes. QCA is a valuable tool to not only explore the
relationship between features of consultation and change for CYP, but
also for any desire to identify causal patterns for complex phenomena.

This research will form part of the picture guiding EPs use of
consultation in the future, such that better outcomes for CYP can be
achieved through engaging in evidence-based practice. The findings of
this thesis will be shared via open access platforms, allowing the
widest readership and thus the greatest impact. By providing EPs with
evidence-based recommendations, their practice will improve and the
positive impact they will have in the communities they work will be
increased.

This work can also be used to help Trainee Educational Psychologists
(TEPs) gain an understanding of what consultation is and how they can be
effective practitioners. Learning how to use consultation effectively is
a foundational aspect of being an EP
[@hatzichristouMultilevelApproachSystemLevel2017]. This research can
help elucidate the core features of consultation and what leads to
change for CYP. It can therefore help ensure TEPs employ evidence-based
practices in their work and support their development of proficiency in
effective consultation, which is essential for all training
[@newellAssessingStateEvidence2014].

# 1 Introduction

This research sought to systematically explore several important strands
related to the use of consultation in EP practice. The first element is
to identify what EPs believe are the key features of consultation. This
will allow EPs and TEPs to gain an informed understanding of what the
core features of consultation are. The difficulty for TEPs in gaining a
clear understanding of the core features of consultation has been
previously identified [@kennedyEffectiveConsultationEducational2009a].
This is primarily due to the small amount of research exploring what
happens during a consultation
[@kennedyEducationalPsychologistsWalk2008a]. As such, a thorough
analysis of what a wide range of EPs believe are the key features will
help elucidate this fundamental but often misunderstood strand of EP
work [@ofarrellResearchExploringParents2018].

The second element explores to what EPs believe are the effective
features of consultation, what makes said features effective, and what
the barriers are to effective consultation. It is not enough to merely
know what the features of consultation are. EPs operate within systems
which require demonstration of efficacy and improved outcomes for CYP
[@britishpsychologicalsocietyQualityStandardsEducational2019]. EPs
therefore need to know what features of consultation lead to positive
change for CYP, what makes these features effective, and what the
barriers to effective consultation are.

The third element relates to an analysis of what combination of features
of consultation correspond with improved outcomes for CYP. Whilst
delving into the views of experienced and informed users of consultation
gives some insight, thorough exploration requires the analysis of this
complex phenomenon through multiple methodologies
[@meyersQualitativeMixedMethods2014]. This is because doing so provides
a more meaningful interpretation of the data and phenomenon
[@teddlieOverviewContemporaryIssues2010] and because it allows
exploration at more than one level of analysis
[@hughesMixedMethodsResearch2016].

The rest of this chapter explains in detail what is understood by
'consultation' as a form of working within an educational psychology
context. The scope of consultation within the UK will be detailed to
provide an understanding of the larger context for the use of
consultation and the issues this presents. Gaps in the academic
literature will then be highlighted. The rationale for this work will
then be explored and an overview of the structure of this thesis will be
given.

## 1.1 What is consultation?

Consultation takes many different forms across contexts and countries.
Consequently, there is not a universal definition of consultation as
conducted by EPs. This raises an important problem for any EP who wishes
to engage in consultation or analyse its efficacy. Within a western
context, it fundamentally involves problem solving between consultants
(EPs) and consultees. The consultee is most often a teacher who knows
the Child or young person well, but it can also be parents and/or
Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCOs). In joint school-family
consultations, it is generally agreed prior to the consultation that at
least one member from the child's family unit and the school will
attend. These individuals collaborate to devise and establish
interventions to help support and find solutions for the client, the CYP
[@ofarrellResearchExploringParents2018]. Consultation is considered a
form of 'indirect' work as the theory is that the EP can enact the most
change for CYP by meeting and working with those around CYP
[@gutkinReconceptualizingSchoolPsychology1990]. Direct work with the
child or young person is often conducted, though is not mandated.

Consultation has become the model of service delivery for many
Educational Psychology Services (EPS)
[@sheridanRandomizedTrialExamining2017]. Most EPS in the UK have moved
towards a predominantly consultation-based service
[@ofarrellResearchExploringParents2018]. This is in contrast with what
is viewed as a more traditional model which predominantly involves
individual casework, typically including the administration of a
cognitive assessment [@kratochwillEvidenceBasedInterventionsSchool2002;
@larneySchoolBasedConsultationUnited2003].

The consultation framework utilised most in the UK is the Wagner model
[@wagnerConsultationApproachEducational1995;
@wagnerSchoolConsultationFrameworks1995;
@wagnerConsultationDevelopingComprehensive2000]. Thus, for a majority of
EPs, consultation is defined as "a voluntary, collaborative,
non-supervisory approach, established to aid the functioning of a system
and as inter-related systems"
[@wagnerConsultationDevelopingComprehensive2000, p. 11] through
"purposeful [conversations] which [use] techniques of listening,
clarifying, problem-solving, challenging, questioning and reflecting"
[@munroAnglesDevelopingConsultation2000, p. 55]. As a result, EPs work
with those closest to the child or young person. However, this is not as
experts telling them how to help the child or young person; their role
is to help empower them to solve their own problems. Wagner believes that taking the role of the expert is "deskilling" [@wagnerConsultationDevelopingComprehensive2000, p. 12] for the consultees as the EP assumes a position of power. Being an expert for Wagner is therefore more than just having detailed knowledge about a range of relevant topics; it is the assumption of an elevated position in the power dynamic which can lead to the dismissing of the views of the consultees. Being collaborative, with equal participation between those involved, and bringing in the voices of those involved is therefore fundamental to the Wagnerian model of consultation.

The focus is not only on the child or young person but their
relations with others and the many different environments they are in,
such as home, school, and their wider community, ideas derived from
[@bronfenbrennerDevelopmentalEcologySpace1995]. There is an
understanding of the interactions between these layers and the need to
consider a child holistically. This support is provided by asking
questions, analysing presenting problems and helping others think
differently, agreeing on potential interventions, and then reflecting on
the whole process so progress can be made.

## 1.2 How prevalent is consultation in the UK?

The move towards a consultation-based model of service is reflected in
government legislation. The Special Education Needs: Code of Practice
characterises consultation as one of the main services of EPs
[@departmentforeducationSENDCodePractice2015]. Several studies have also
found it makes up a large percentage of their time working with schools.
One such study is @shannonEducationalPsychologistEarly2007. In this
work, researchers delivered questionnaires to 44 EPs, asking for the EPs
to self-report how often they undertook different types of work,
including consultation or case work. 32 responded, with most reporting
they spent most of their time engaging in individual level work. 91% of
the EPs who were engaging in individual level work stated consultation
was the main activity performed. However, the authors did not provide a
definition of consultation nor ask the EPs to provide a definition of
consultation. Given that consultation takes many different forms and
there are a wide range of views on consultation between EPs and other
stakeholders, ensuring everyone has the same definition of the process
is crucial. Without it, one cannot be sure different EPs are engaging in
consultation in a similar way and that the schools understand the
process. Participants may have reported they used consultation, but in
practice their methods may be very different. Because of the limits of
self-report, we do not know if such a disparity exists in this study. On
the other hand, the EPs who responded were from a large range of
locations across the UK, thus increasing the representativeness of the
data and our confidence that the results can apply to other EPs.

Another study exploring the prevalence of consultation in the UK comes
from @leadbetterPatternsServiceDelivery2000. For this research, the
authors sent questionnaires to all Principal Educational Psychologists
and asked about their models of service delivery. Consultation was
reported as one of the most frequently used models. However, there was
only a return rate of 58%, with those not returning almost certainly not
randomly distributed. There is therefore uncertainty around the amount
of bias in the results. If the non-returns were randomly distributed on
key variables, such as whether the EPs has recently experienced
organisational changes, then a low return rate would not introduce bias
into the results. But this is unlikely. As such, the results of certain
PEPs who may have different results from the norm are missing. This
presents a coloured picture that may not accurately reflect the
experience of EPs in the UK

## 1.3 Gaps in the literature

Although consultation forms the bedrock of many EPs work and the model
of service delivery for EPS, EPs often struggle to articulate what a
consultation model of service entails.
@leadbetterRoleMediatingArtefacts2004 states there is little research
which explicates the structure and process of consultation. This
situation has not improved over the following years, with the few
studies examining this typically only focusing on one EPS or a small
number of EPs [@cordingStudyEducationalPsychologists2011;
@leadbetterInvestigatingConceptualisingNotion2006;
@pipherConsultationApproachTeacher2013a]. These limitations prohibit one
from developing a broad picture of how consultation is performed in the
UK

This lack of clarity subsequently has a significant impact on EPs
ability to measure the efficacy of consultation. If a clear definition
and set of features of consultation has not yet been established,
assessing the efficacy of it is very difficult. To demonstrate that
consultation is effective, the mechanisms through which consultation
leads to positive change need to be measured. As such, the key features
need to be identified and then linked with recorded progress for CYP. If
the key features are not known, EPs putatively engaging in consultation
cannot be certain that they truly are using consultation. They also
cannot be confident that the practices they are using within
consultation lead to positive change for CYP. Given the need of EPs to
demonstrate the efficacy of their work
[@fallonDiscussionDevelopingRole2010b], this poses serious problems for
their ability to work in an ethical and effective manner.

## 1.4 Rationale

The purpose of this research was to gain an insight into what EPs
believe are the effective features of consultation, why they believe
they are effective, what the barriers to effective consultation are,
what happens during an EP-led consultation, and what combination of
features are seen when compared to rated progress towards agreed goals.
Gaining an understanding of what EPs believe are the core features of
consultation allows EPs to understand what is essential for a
consultation to occur. Exploring what they believe are the effective
features and why can help guide future EPs and TEPs to increase the
efficacy of their consultations.

Having a more fine-grained understanding of when different features are
seen and how frequently would provide valuable insight into what are the
core feature of a consultation. This could then be cross-referenced with
the ratings of progress as measured by TME. It can also be used to
explore how accurate EPs are in their judgements as to what they think
are effective features of consultation. The correspondence between the
combination of observed features and progress is important because all
EPS are expected to be able to demonstrate efficacy. This efficacy is
generally conceived of as improvement for the CYP the EP is working with
[@connorTargetMonitoringEvaluation2010]. It is therefore important that
EPs can substantiate claims of efficacy for certain methods, such as
consultation. Given this, the present study seeks to draw a link between
what features occur in consultations and are seen with rated progress.
By understanding what the core features of consultation are and which
features make it effective, this will inform the professions
understanding of what is required for a consultation to occur and how to
increase the chances of engaging in consultations which lead to positive
outcomes for CYP.

Mixed methods were chosen because of the desire to explore the
phenomenon (effective consultations) more completely than a single
methodology could provide [@robsonRealWorldResearch2015]. Mixed methods
have been previously used to examine consultation at different levels
whilst respecting the complexity of the systems it is used in, for
example @bennAnalysisInstructionalConsultants2008. The method chosen for
the qualitative arm of the research was interviews, as this is one of
the best tools to thoroughly explore the views of those who are most
knowledgeable about the phenomenon [@meyersQualitativeMixedMethods2014].
As such, EPs were interviewed to gain an understanding of their views of
the effective features of consultation as they have first-hand
experience of when consultations are and are not effective.

The most appropriate quantitative approach to accompany the interviews
is observations. This is because of the value of observing real-world
consultations and systematically examining the features present.
Previous arguments have been made that the qualitative exploration of
consultation is insufficient; observation of real-world consultations is
essential to accurately examine this process
[@henning-stoutConsultationConnectedKnowing1994]. Mixed methods also
help to offset the weaknesses of each approach and increase the strength
of possible inferences [@robsonRealWorldResearch2015]. Equal weighting
was given to each form of evidence, and each can be used to inform the
other and provide more depth.

## 1.4 Thesis structure

This thesis is comprised of five chapters. Chapter 2 provides a detailed
theoretical background to this work, identifying previous research which
has sought to explain what key stakeholders' views towards consultation
are, what are understood to be the key features of consultation, and
previous attempts to assess the efficacy of consultation.

Chapter 3 details the methodology employed to address the research
questions. A theoretical justification for the chosen methods is also
provided. The procedure for each arm of the research is given, along
with the data analysis and a critique of each method.

Chapter 4 begins by laying out the results for the qualitative results.
A detailed analysis of the codes and emerging themes is provided. The
quantitative results are then given. The initial observations are
presented, followed by the two stages of QCA.

Chapter 5 critically analyses the findings and draws links to the extant
research. The limitations of the research, including critiques of the
methodologies and practical limitations of the samples, are then
explored. Reflections by the researcher are then provided. Finally,
conclusions are drawn and links to EP practice are made.

# 2 Literature Review

A literature review was conducted to see what previous research had
identified as the consultees and EPs views of consultation, what the
main features of consultation are, and what the main tools of analysing
the efficacy of consultation were. Various databases, including Web of
Science and Scopus, were searched using the key words "educational
psychology", "consultation", and "efficacy". Further reading was
identified from the references lists of several papers used. Key
references, such as @kennedyEducationalPsychologistsWalk2008a, were
given to the researcher by their supervisor to set a baseline for the
literature review. Due to the paucity of published research, especially
for assessing the efficacy of consultation, the grey literature
[@paezGreyLiteratureImportant2017] was also examined. The grey
literature refers to documents not published in journals or commercial
publications, such as doctoral theses, unpublished articles, and
independent reports.

The purpose of this chapter is to first establish what consultation is
believed to be according to the stakeholders (consultees and EPs). Then,
the relevant literature detailing previous attempts to identify the key
features of consultation will be examined. An explanation of the two
most common theoretical models will also be provided. The Local Offer
literature of London Boroughs will be analysed to gain an understanding
of how some EPS advertise themselves and their public portrayal of
consultation. Then, literature seeking to evaluate the efficacy of
consultation will be evaluated. The context of this thesis will then be
highlighted, leading to the research questions which motivate this piece
of research.

## 2.1 What are consultees views on consultation?

Prior to exploring what occurs in a consultation, understanding what
those involved (EPs, teachers) believe it to be is valuable. This is
because if consultees are to play an active role in consultations (as
all models of consultation state they should), their views of
consultation need to be understood. That way, any misunderstandings can
be cleared up and consultation can be effective. To serve this end, the
following section explores stakeholders' views of consultation as
detailed in the relevant scientific literature.
@ofarrellResearchExploringParents2018 interviewed three groups
containing a teacher, an EP, and the parents of the child. The teachers
and parents reported that while they appreciated and saw the value of
consultation, there was a lack of understanding regarding its process
and nature. All three teachers implied they viewed the EP as the
external expert, who had specialist knowledge and access to resources
which they wanted. This is in direct contrast to the sentiments
expressed by the EPs in this study. They explicitly stated they were not
experts and tried to distance themselves from that sentiment. This
concept is fundamental to many models of consultation, including
@wagnerSchoolConsultationFrameworks1995. This research was conducted in
the Republic of Ireland. Here, consultation has only become the dominant
model of service delivery in recent years. Thus, UK based teachers and
SENCOs may have a better understanding. However, few pieces of research
have been conducted to explore understanding of this important strand of
EP work.

@dennisFarGoodQualitative2004 interviewed SENCOs at twelve schools to
better understand their views on EP work. One of the core themes raised
by the participants was a wish for EPS to "publicise more the range of
things it has to offer and good/innovative practice". The exact number
of schools which held this belief is unknown as that information was not
reported in the paper. Regarding consultation, there was a large
heterogeneity in the school's understanding of it. Some schools were
fully aware of the consultation model of service delivery and preferred
it to previous models. Such models focused on direct work, including
assessment of CYP using cognitive assessments. However, other schools
either did not understand the consultation model or were only partially
aware of it but preferred other models which placed a primacy on
child-focused individual work. They reported they believed the
consultation model involved "too much talk, not enough action"
[@dennisFarGoodQualitative2004, 22] and thus did not value it as highly.

This lack of understanding of consultation is found in other countries
as well. Many Australian EPS have also shifted their focus from an
assessment-based to a consultation-based model of service delivery. But
they also experience a lack of clarity in understanding among
stakeholders regarding the meaning and process of consultation
[@bellPerceptionsRealitiesRole2013]. However, some EPs do not report
this problem. In the U.S.A., those who work with school psychologists
(as EPs are called) show a greater consistency of understanding of
consultation in schools. There is also a larger evidence base for the
efficacy of their form of consultation. This is because consultation as
practised in the U.S.A. is almost exclusively Conjoint Behavioural
Consultation (CBC). CBC is defined as "a strength-based, cross-system
problem-solving and decision-making model wherein parents, teachers, and
other caregivers or service providers work as partners and share
responsibility for promoting positive and consistent outcomes related to
a child's academic, behavioural, and social--emotional development"
[@sheridanConjointBehavioralConsultation2007, p.25]. CBC has been shown
to be effective for CYP over a wide range of settings and for many
presenting problems [@sheridanRandomizedTrialExamining2017]. This
hegemony of practice allows for a consistent definition and
implementation and is likely one of the reasons consultation in the
U.S.A. is better understood and valued by stakeholders
[@reddyClinicalFocusConsultation2000]. It also means its efficacy can be
assessed more readily, such as by conducting a randomised control trial
conducted as done by @sheridanRandomizedTrialExamining2012.

On the other hand, the lack of understanding by key stakeholders
(SENCOs, teachers, and parents) may not truly reflect the modern-day
conception of consultation in the UK. Most of the research reporting
these findings is roughly 15 years old. It is reasonable to presume
stakeholders have become more familiar with it, given how prevalent it
is. A more recent paper exploring this is
@cordingStudyEducationalPsychologists2011. For this work, the authors
interviewed 10 school personnel (such as Head teachers and teachers) and
9 EPs in a Welsh Local Authority (LA). The aim was to elicit their
understanding of the kinds of work they believed EPs conducted. There
was a general alignment between the views of the school personnel and
the EPs themselves. But the school personnel stated they greatly valued
the EPs expertise in diagnosing and alleviating presenting problems.
This shows that despite there being a shared understanding of what EPs
do, there is still a divide in what stakeholders value about EP work.

## 2.2 What are consultants' views on consultation?

Most EPs have a positive view of consultation, with the Local Offer
literature from many EPS stating their model of service delivery is
consultation, such as Kensington & Chelsea
[@royalboroughofkensingtonchelseaEducationalPsychologyService2019]. Some
EPs believe they provide a unique method of working through their use of
consultation [@ashtonWhatValuableUnique2006].
@ashtonWhatValuableUnique2006 sent questionnaires to both schools and
EPs asking for them to comment on the work EPs engage in. 22
questionnaires (out of 58) were returned from mainstream primary schools
and eight (out of nine) EPs completed the questionnaire. 'Statutory
assessment work', 'Closed tests' and 'Expert role' were the most
frequently provided parts of EP work that were classed as unique by
SENCOs. Few or no other agencies were judged by SENCOs as providing a
similar or the same service as EPs. 'Individual assessment and
intervention' and 'Consultation' were the aspects of EP work the EPs
themselves believed were unique to them, as no other service provided
these. This shows a clear disparity between the views of EPs and key
stakeholders within consultation (SENCOs). They also reported that
SENCOs typically valued more traditional EP work, such as individual
assessment and giving advice. The SENCOs did not value consultation, nor
give evidence they had a complete understanding of it. However, these
results should be interpreted with caution. The small sample limited to
one LA undermines our ability to generalise the results to a wider
context. It also only collected data from mainstream primary schools,
further limiting the scope of these results. Yet one of the main
results, namely the lack of understanding regarding the nature of
consultation, has been replicated by research in other school settings
[@dennisFarGoodQualitative2004; @ofarrellResearchExploringParents2018].

## 2.3 What are the main features of consultation?

Once a common understanding of what the stakeholders believe
consultation is has been created, an analysis of the common features of
consultation can occur. The following section will evaluate the relevant
literature regarding the features of consultation.
@hendersonExplorationImpactConsultation2013 used focus groups with
clusters of SENCOs across a small LA to gain an understanding of their
beliefs about the mechanics of consultation. The researchers sat in on
five different Primary SENCO Network meetings and worked to gather their
views. @hendersonExplorationImpactConsultation2013 presented the
participants with statements about parts of the consultation process.
Their task was to sort them depending on how often they believed the
statements to be a part of a consultation. The mostly commonly given
features of consultation were: discussing issues with relevant parties;
information gathering; and it being a reflexive process with a focus on
collaboratively crafting solutions. They also conducted semi-structured
interviews with EPs, children who were receiving EP involvement, and
their parents. It being a collaborative and problem-solving process,
with a focus on solutions, and the development of positive working
relationships between those involved were the two main themes. The use
of focus groups to identify SENCO beliefs regarding the nature of
consultation and interviews with the stakeholders allowed comparison
between the stakeholders' expectations and the reality of consultation.
However, given the researchers did not directly observe consultations
but relied on self-report, the conclusions that can be drawn regarding
how consultations are conducted are weakened. This is because of the
disparity between self-reports of behaviour and real-world instances of
behaviour [@argyrisTheoryPracticeIncreasing1992].

@kennedyEducationalPsychologistsWalk2008a thematically analysed the
voice recordings of 17 EP-teacher consultations. These individual case
studies [@robsonRealWorldResearch2015] were supplemented by a
pre-consultation questionnaire completed by EPs to establish their
espoused theory for consultation. A comparison could then be made
between the recordings and participants' self-report to see whether
their espoused theory aligned with the recorded behaviours. The authors
report a high correspondence between the EPs espoused theory and theory
in practice as EPs predominantly engaged in behaviours dictated by their
espoused theory. The most common behaviours by EPs were working
collaboratively, typically with those most involved (predominantly
parents) using either the problem-analysis framework or Solution-Focused
approaches (a detailed account of these models of consultation will be
provided in the following subsection). By recording the consultations,
the authors could gather data from a larger number of consultations than
they could have if they sat in on every consultation. However, there was
a low granularity of analysis. The researchers only assessed whether
features of the espoused theory appeared at all during the consultation.
Thus, the analysis only shows that during a consultation, EPs brought in
ideas from their espoused theory at least once. There was no analysis of
how frequently the ideas appeared and when during the consultations. It
therefore cannot tell us how great a part these concepts from the
espoused theory played in the consultation, merely that they were
present.

@nolanProcessPsychologicalConsultation2014 observed seven consultations
between five EPs, a teacher, and at least one parent. A week later, the
researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with all EPs and
teachers and some of the parents. Several key themes arose from the
observations and interviews. These were: empowering those involved in
the consultation; working collaboratively; the importance of each
participant in the consultation recognising the valuable knowledge from
others; reviewing outcomes; and EPs using their expertise to support
others (without emphasising their role as the "expert"). The use of both
observation and interview generates a lot of data about these 7
consultations, giving a very detailed understanding of the process. It
also allows corroboration between data collection methods. However, the
small sample size limits the generalisability of the findings. These
results therefore need to be replicated with different configurations of
participants and in other school settings.

@ofarrellResearchExploringParents2018 found teachers appreciated
consultation as they felt empowered to support the pupils who had been
referred. According to @jonesRefocusingEducationPsychology1990, this
empowering of consultees rather than fixing the consultees problems or
simply giving advice, is part of the definition of consultation.
@dennisFarGoodQualitative2004 found that EPs and SENCOs saw several key
issues relating to the successful implementation of a consultation
model: the EP having a detailed knowledge of the system (school) they
were working in; addressing issues at multiple levels (rather than just
on the individual level); positive relationships between the EP and
SENCO; and empowering staff to successfully address their problems,
rather than doing it for them.

@dickinsonConsultationAssuringQuality2000a &
@munroAnglesDevelopingConsultation2000 examined how consultation had
been implemented in their EPS (Lincolnshire and Buckinghamshire
respectively). Behaviours and approaches which helped support the
successful implementation of consultation across both EPS included:
having purposeful conversations; EPs using their psychological knowledge
during consultations; and all parties involved deciding on interventions
as well as reviewing past and current interventions. Factors that were
only reported in @munroAnglesDevelopingConsultation2000 included:
engaging in preventative work; improving outcomes; and engaging in
multi-level collaborative work. Unfortunately, these papers are based on
the author's reflections on the implementation of consultation in their
LA and do not give the views of anyone else or provide much in the way
of data to support their findings. Readers must therefore take them at
their word.

@smillieEducationalPsychologistsPractice2020 explored how EPs gain the
voice of CYP, which has been identified as an essential part of the
consultation process [@departmentforeducationSENDCodePractice2015].
Valuing the voice of CYP also aligns with the Bronfenbrenner theory of
viewing CYP at the centre of a complex web of interconnected systems.
The model Involving CYP in the assessment, planning, and review stages
of EP has been put forward as beneficial because of increased motivation
and feeling of responsibility for change and can be done using a range
of theories, such as Solution-Focused approaches
[@rollerFacilitatingPupilInvolvement1998]. This research explored one
feature (voice of CYP) in a wide range of EPS using a mixed methodology,
thus allowing a detailed exploration of said feature. However, this
research only explored the views of EPs regarding eliciting the voice of
CYP, ironically denying CYP a say in how their views are collected and
whether it is effective. As such, there is a lack of research detailing
how CYP believe their views can be effectively collected and factored
into the work for them.

This research builds on a previous piece of work by the lead researcher.
This first work explored what EPs believe the key features of a
consultation are and what happened in an initial consultation between at
least an EP and a school staff member. This was done through a novel
questionnaire asking EPs to rank features of consultation according to
their importance and thematically analysing transcripts of
consultations. During the consultations, the two most frequent features
of consultation were 'Understanding the presenting problem' and 'Working
together to come up with solutions'. EPs rated these as core features of
consultation in the questionnaire, as well as improving outcomes for
young people. Whilst this research assessed what EPs believe the core
features are and what the features are of an initial consultation, the
small sample size (3 observed consultations and 8 EPs completing the
questionnaire) means the results are hard to generalise beyond the
immediate consultations.

Although these studies typically only focused on a small number of
participants, the consistency in results allows fundamental features of
consultation to be gleaned. The studies also cover a wide range of EPS,
so the results are not limited to a specific region. This increases the
generalisability of the findings. However, despite these consistencies,
there is still a great deal of heterogeneity in consultation models and
practice. EPs can state they are engaging in consultation, but without
more information or a previously established working relationship, those
involved (parents, teachers, etc.) are unlikely to know what to expect
with a consultation. An arguably more serious consequence is that
assessing the efficacy of consultation is very difficult. If
consultations are not ergodic due to the very wide range of features,
any assessment of consultation may not be valid for consultations
performed by an individual EP. Therefore, assessing the efficacy of
consultations is difficult. This is against the backdrop of EPs working
within 'traded services' [@leeExplorationDevelopingRole2017], where the
ability to demonstrate efficacy is highly valued. It therefore behoves
EPs to gain an understanding of the consistent features of consultation.
This will allow some assessment of which combination of features are
sufficient to lead to improved outcomes for CYP.

### 2.3.1 Models of consultation

The theoretical models of consultation have been explored in a number of
papers. The two most common are the problem-analysis framework
[@monsenAccountableModelPractice1998] and solution-focused techniques,
derived from Solution-Focused Brief Therapy
[@deshazerKeysSolutionBrief1985a]. The problem-analysis framework is
related to behavioural consultation
[@berganBehavioralConsultationTherapy1990] and is divided into four
stages: problem identification, problem analysis, intervention
implementation, and intervention evaluation
[@sheridanSchoolConsultation2000]. Those working directly with the young
person, such as teachers, are involved throughout
[@kennedyEffectiveConsultationEducational2009a]. This framework operates
under the assumption that 'subsequent actions and interventions will be
more successful because they are based upon a more accurate analysis of
presenting difficulties' [@woolfsonIntegratedFrameworkGuide2003]. This
thorough understanding of the presenting difficulty allows the EP to
generate 'initial guiding hypotheses based upon psychological theory and
research about the nature and causes of the presenting problem
situation' [@woolfsonIntegratedFrameworkGuide2003]. These hypotheses
serve as the guiding force behind discussions with consultees and help
identify other areas to be explored. This model has been found to be
'highly effective in some executive areas'
[@kellyExploringUsefulnessMonsen2006] but criticisms have been levelled
at it. One such criticism relates to the perceived inflexibility of it
[@wicksFrameworksEnableEducational2013], leading to the updated model
with greater flexibility and bi-directionality
[@monsenMonsenProblemSolving2008].

This model is in contrast with the other most common model that informs
consultation: a Solution-Focused approach. This is characterised by
greater interest in the solutions to presenting problems rather than the
problem itself. This is because those who employ solution-focused ideals
believe that a focus on the problem is not necessary to effect change
[@deshazerKeysSolutionBrief1985a]. Times when the problem is not as
severe or is absent, called 'exceptions'
[@deshazerWordsWereOriginally1994a], are explored. This is to help
emphasise to the client that they have the skills and resources to
overcome their own difficulties, as they have done so in the past
[@deshazerKeysSolutionBrief1985a]. The EP helps facilitate this
discussion of exceptions and helps the client realise their own
resources to overcome their issues
[@rhodesSolutionFocusedThinking2004a]. Co-operation between the client
and therapist is fundamental to the success of this approach
[@deshazerDeathResistance1984]. Given this work was originally created
for adults in a clinical setting, it had to be adapted for use by EPs in
schools. @ajmalSolutionsSchoolsCreative2001 detailed the 6 pragmatic
assumptions for use of SF approaches in schools to help EPs use this
model within their practice. A recent meta-analysis on the efficacy of
solution-focused approaches in a number of settings found that all
studies included stated that at least one measure reported a positive
impact of solution-focused approaches. However, the low typical sample
size of the included studies raises concerns around the validity of
significant results reflecting a true result
[@buttonPowerFailureWhy2013].

## 2.4 Local Offer literature

To gain an understanding of what EPs at different LAs understood
consultation to be, the Local Offer literature was examined. This
information was found on the LA's websites and detailed what services
the EPS provided. Despite almost all services having moved to a
consultation-based service delivery
[@dinkmeyerConsultationCreatingSchoolBased2016], over a third of LAs did
not explicitly mention consultation. Of those that did, the most cited
feature was working with relevant parties, such as teachers. The second
most common was improving outcomes for CYP, with the importance of
looking for solutions (including the use of Solution-Focused approaches)
also being mentioned frequently. What this shows is that for the LAs
that mention it, the EPs working there have explicitly stated the
importance of collaborating with those closest to the CYP and the
necessity of improving CYP's outcomes.

## 2.5 Assessing the efficacy of consultation

There have been calls for assessing the efficacy of EP work for decades,
such as @clineQualityAssuranceEducational1994a, but this has become even
more important since the almost complete shift to 'traded services'
[@nationalcollegeforteachingandleadershipEducationalPsychologyWorkforce2014].
'Traded services' marks a shift in funding towards existing service
organisations needing to generate income from schools (seen as
customers) to either partially or fully financially support itself
[@woodsPreparationPractitionerEducational2014]. Many EPs feel a pressure
from schools to both provide something tangible for customers and to
demonstrate the effectiveness of their work, so schools buy their
services again [@leeExplorationDevelopingRole2017]. EPs are also
expected to use evidence-based tools and to critically evaluate their
practice [@britishpsychologicalsocietyQualityStandardsEducational2015,
Standard 4.8;
@healthcareprofessionscouncilStandardsProficiencyPractitioner2015a,
Standard 12.1] as part of the requirements of practicing as an EP. It is
therefore very important for EPs to understand what aspects of
consultation are effective in eliciting change.

However, measuring such change is difficult. As
@kennedyEducationalPsychologistsWalk2008a notes, due to the complex
nature of the interactions between consultant, consultee, and client it
is difficult to decide what to measure and how to do so. Several methods
have been put forward, but none have gained ascendancy yet. One method
used by some EPS [@hampshireepsHowEducationalPsychology2010] is the
Target Monitoring Evaluation [@dunsmuirEvidenceBasedPractice2009]. TME
is based on Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS), which was developed by
@kiresukGoalAttainmentScaling1968 to evaluate the outcomes of mental
health interventions. TME is a streamlined form of GAS, with the added
advantage of increased granularity in evaluating progress in relation to
expected progress. TME involves the negotiated development of SMART
goals between the EP and the consultees. To examine the suitability of
using TME forms with consultations, @dunsmuirEvidenceBasedPractice2009
incorporated TME forms into the practice of eight assistant EPs in one
county and 13 EPs based in two Local Authorities. During the initial
consultation, after the goals had been decided upon, each participant
rated how far along on a 10-point scale the child currently was towards
each goal. They then stated how far they expected the child to be when
they had their review consultation. 6-8 weeks later, during the review
consultation, each participant rated how far the child had actually
progressed, which was compared with how far they were predicted to
progress. Interviews were conducted with teachers, SENCOs, and
headteachers, who gave positive feedback on the easy and efficiency of
the process, as well as how the tool helped focus on setting of targets.
Two of those interviewed had experience with GAS and stated they
preferred TME. Focus groups of EPs and assistant EPs elicited positive
views towards the tool, as well as considerations of implementation.

This pilot study gives evidence for TMEs efficacy in assessing progress
in response to EP intervention. However, the limited detail provided in
the report means we do not have a fine-grained understanding of the
strengths and weaknesses of the tool. @monsenEvaluationPreTraining2009
assessed the efficacy of assistant EPs using TME and focus groups with
stakeholders. Both measures found assistant EPs to be beneficial to EP
work. This work was conducted in one EPS; therefore, the
generalisability of the findings is limited. Given that TME is a
quantitative assessment of efficacy and the focus groups produced
qualitative data, direct comparison of efficacy between the two measures
is difficult. As such, strong conclusions about the validity of TME when
assessing educational psychology work cannot be drawn.

There have been a few studies which have attempted to compare TME with
other quantitative measures of change, such as
@connorTargetMonitoringEvaluation2010. In this thesis, the author
compared TME with other, more established forms of progress measurement
in domains like reading, such as the York Assessment of Reading
Comprehension (YARC). They report that there was broad agreement between
the TME and other forms of assessment; when other forms of assessment
found improvement, this was reflected in the reported change through the
TME forms. However, while TME may be useful for identifying progress in
individual children, it was not clear how it could be used to assess the
quality of the work from the EP. There were also some difficulties
regarding the use of it, as there was disagreement between some
consultants and consultees regarding target setting and the voice of the
child.

A recent paper [@eddlestonUsingProfessionalPractice2018] comparing
different consultation evaluation tools excluded TME because it did not
reach the inclusion criteria. Here, TMEs streamlined nature counted
against it as it was not sufficiently thorough enough to be evaluated.
This means there is limited evidence for its efficacy as a tool.
However, as @dunsmuirEvidenceBasedPractice2009 states, "the strengths of
GAS are maintained but the TME system is more streamlined and user
friendly" (p. 67). We can therefore have increased confidence in the
suitability of TME as a measure of change, given that GAS has been shown
to be a useful tool [@roachGoalAttainmentScaling2005] and it shares
fundamental similarities.

## 2.6 Context

This project was greatly shaped by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic
and the subsequent response by the British Government. Because of this,
the research was conducted during unprecedented circumstances. All EPs
(and workers in general) had to work remotely from home. This brought up
unique concerns for how EPs worked, as they were not allowed to see any
adults or CYP in person. However, this also presented the profession
with an opportunity to further develop their professional practice with
regards to consultation. Because almost all contact between members of
different households was prohibited, consultations conducted remotely
became the most appropriate (and occasionally only) way for EPs to work.
The importance of consultation was therefore increased by the sudden
demands placed on the profession by the global crisis. This also,
therefore, increased the importance of identifying effective features of
consultation and which combination of features led to positive change
for CYP.

To support EPs and TEPs during this novel working environment, several
documents, such as @bhardwajRapidLiteratureReview2020, and one piece of
research
[@associationforeducationalpsychologistsSurveyEffectsCovid192020] were
disseminated during this time, detailing guidance as to how EPs can work
ethically within the context of a lockdown. This included conducting
consultations using either phones or video call software, such as
Microsoft Teams or Zoom. There were concerns regarding the safety and
privacy of Zoom technology [@paulZoomMalwareWhy2020] so Teams was
encouraged by many EPS. This shifted the way the research could be
conducted: consultations could not be observed in person and many EPs
were not engaging in consultation. The timeline of the research was
changed as a result, with the observation of consultations pushed back
to September 2020 when it was hoped they would resume by.

## 2.7 Research questions

Given the lack of strong theory in this area of research, research
questions were developed but statistical hypotheses could not be drawn.
Thus, it is exploratory research
[@kimmelmanDistinguishingExploratoryConfirmatory2014]. The general aim
of this research was to identify, through observations and interviews,
what the key features of consultations that lead to change for CYP are.
This was done by asking EPs what they believed the effective features of
consultation are, what makes them effective, and then observing
consultations and systematically noting which features occurred. This
allowed the comparison of said features with progress towards agreed
goals for various CYP and whether they reflected the views of EPs. As
such, the research questions (RQs) were:

1.  What are the core features of an effective consultation?

    i)  What do EPs believe are the key features of an effective
        consultation?

    ii) What do EPs believe are the barriers to effective consultation?

    iii) What do EPs believe makes those features effective?

2.  Which combination of features of consultation are seen with progress
    towards agreed goals?

# 3 Methodology

## 3.1 Epistemology and research paradigm

To explore these questions, a mixed methodology was employed, making use
of quantitative and qualitative research methods. It was informed by a
scientific realism epistemology. Scientific realism can help approach
difficult problems in social science as it considers the complexity of
the situation in which they occur [@houseRealismResearch1991]. It can be
viewed as a pragmatic approach [@robsonRealWorldResearch2015] as it is
less concerned with philosophical dualisms, such as rationalism versus
empiricism, and more with practical considerations of issues and
potential solutions [@johnsonMixedMethodsResearch2004a]. Mixed
methodology aligns with a pragmatic approach as it is not beholden to
one method of exploring a research topic; it sees the benefits of both
for exploring a research question in different ways
[@denscombeCommunitiesPracticeResearch2008]. Multiple methods of inquiry
were employed because it is generally believed using different means to
explore research questions brings greater rigour
[@creswellResearchDesignQualitative2003a]. Data can be triangulated with
one another, with evidence corroborating, refuting, or adding nuance to
each other and increasing confidence in one's findings
[@munafoRobustResearchNeeds2018]. Mixed methodology research designs can
be divided along a key dimension: paradigm emphasis
[@johnsonMixedMethodsResearch2004a]. This refers to whether one strand
of the research (quantitative or qualitative) is given greater emphasis
during analysis. Because equal weight was placed on both forms of
inquiry, this was an 'equal weight' paradigm emphasis piece. An explicit
account of the ways in which the qualitative and quantitative arms of
the research relate to one another is provided.

## 3.2 Participants

Ethical approval was obtained from UCL the Institute of Education's
Ethical Committee. The inclusion criteria for both arms of the research
were: an EP or TEP who used consultation as part of their practice.
There were no requirements as to how frequently or recently it had to be
used, nor experience or location. Nor were there requirements around the
definition of consultation, just that EPs believed themselves to be
engaging in consultation. This was to try and elicit a wide a range of
views on consultations from practicing EPs. For the interview and
observation, participants were recruited via the researcher's EPS.
Convenience sampling was therefore used. This was because participant
recruitment for the observation was judged to be difficult and the
researcher would have greater success by asking participants they
already had a professional relationship with. The interview also
recruited participants by sharing calls for participants on a popular
mailing list for EPs and other education professionals (EPNET) and
social media (Twitter). Participants were also asked to share the call
for participants with other EPs at their work. Thus, a mixture of
convenience and snowball sampling [@robsonRealWorldResearch2015] was
employed for the two arms of the research. 

Prior to participating, each
participant gave informed consent. It was explained to them they could
withdraw from the study at any point and their data would be destroyed.
All the data from participants who consented would be stored anonymously
on the Open Science Framework, an open-source project which allows open
collaboration between scientists by providing a platform to store and
share data and materials.

30 EPs of varying roles and locations were interviewed. Participant's
roles included TEPs, maingrade EPs, specialist EPs, senior EPs, and
Principal EPs. The participants worked in locations such as London,
Yorkshire, Wales, and the Republic of Ireland.

6 different consultations for 4 children were observed. The children
were not present for any of these consultations. These consultations
were led by 2 EPs. Child 1 had one joint home-school consultation. Child
2 had one parent consultation and one school consultation. Child 3 had
one parent consultation. And child 4 had one school consultation
followed by one parent consultation. See Appendix A for a full breakdown
of which consultations involved which EPs and consultees and were for
which children.

## 3.3 Materials

All materials, along with raw data, are released under a CC-BY license,
thus allowing re-use of materials, and improving reproducibility and
transparency [@nosekScientificUtopiaII2012a]. They can be accessed at:
<https://osf.io/6px7q/> in the 'Methods' folder. Almost all materials
and software used were Free/Libre and Open-Source Software
[@stallmanFLOSSFOSS2016].

### 3.3.1 Interviews

A semi-structured interview format was used because an interview
schedule was developed (Appendix B) which served as a checklist of areas
to be explored with a given question order and wording. However, the
order and wording were allowed to change given the flow of the
interview. Additional questions were used to further develop an
interviewee's answer [@robsonRealWorldResearch2015]. Interviews were
chosen because they allow the interviewee to explain in detail their
thoughts and were judged to be the suitable means to explore the first
RQ. EPs have the greatest knowledge about consultation and are thus in
the best position to be able to explain what the effective features of
it are. Semi-structured interviews were chosen because the researcher
conducted all the interviews and could thus explore answers in greater
detail given their knowledge of the area. However, given this intimacy
with the research questions and purpose of the study, there is a risk
the researcher may ask leading questions to further a certain outcome.
Thus, the core questions were agreed prior to the first interview to try
and minimise bias.

The interviews were of the focused type as the questions centred around
the key theme of consultation [@mertonFocusedInterviewManual1990]. The
core of this theme related to why EPs use consultation, what EPs believe
the key features of consultation are, why they are effective, what the
barriers to consultation are, and what is the unique contribution of
consultation. Barriers were explored because exploring this can help
reveal what the effective features of consultation are as often barriers
are a lack of an effective feature or the opposite of an effective
feature. The unique contribution of consultation was asked to further
explore what EPs believe makes consultation effective. This was so that
the RQs being explored could be asked about in different forms without
repeating any questions.

Probes (interview devices to elicit more information) were employed by
the researcher to further develop the interviewee's responses. To
achieve this, 'laddering questions' (questions phrased in a variety of
ways asking for the interviewee to expand on their answer) and
'summarising techniques' (summarising what has just been said by the
interviewee to prompt more information), as well as 'addition probes' to
maintain the flow of the conversation
[@zeiselInquiryDesignEnvironment2006].

### 3.3.2 Observation

#### 3.3.2.1 Systematic observation

The quantitative arm of the research involved systematic observations of
consultations between an EP and either the parent, class teacher, or
both. Thus, it was a naturalistic observation as the participants were
observed in their typical environment without any interference from the
researcher [@viglioccoTipofthetonguePsychology2001]. Observation was
chosen as it helps overcome the often-recorded discrepancy between what
people say they do and how they behave in the real-world. This has been
reported in such wide-ranging fields as smartphone use
[@andrewsSelfReportToolsCompare2015a] to driving behaviours
[@kayeComparisonSelfreportObjective2018].

Systematic observation was chosen because of the previous research
identifying features of consultation. The researcher therefore judged
that all the relevant observable features had been identified prior to
data collection. These observable features were developed into a coding
scheme (see Appendix C for the definition of each feature) to identify
categories over the course of a set period. The categories were defined
and operationalised prior to data collection
[@crollSystematicClassroomObservation1986]. They were derived from the
relevant literature and were mutually exclusive. The categories were
limited to what was explicitly said because this would help reduce the
amount of interpretation needed for behaviours such as non-verbal
interactions. Thus, features were defined as utterances by participants
within the consultation. This was done to minimise the amount of
inference the researcher had to use when deciding whether a category was
observed [@crollSystematicClassroomObservation1986].

Models of consultation, such as Solution-focused and problem-analysis,
were broken down into their constituent observable parts, such as
planning/implementing interventions and exploring strengths. These two
were chosen as they are often cited as the core models by EPs
[@kennedyEducationalPsychologistsWalk2008a]. This was so the categories
were more fine- grained, and which specific features of the models were
used during consultations could be identified. Commonly cited concepts
in the literature such as 'collaborative' were split into explicit
examples of those concepts, such as Everyone's contributions valued.

Event sampling was used as the absolute and relative frequency of events
was of interest [@robsonRealWorldResearch2015]. A sequence record was
also used to provide information as to the order in which the features
were seen, thus providing information about transitions
[@robsonRealWorldResearch2015]. Time sampling was not chosen so no
events were missed because they fell outside of the time intervals.
However, the length of time each feature occurred for was lost. Whilst
this information would be valuable to see how long each feature lasted
for, rather than just how frequently it occurred, it was decided that
the risk of missing feature due to the researcher focusing on correctly
marking the time of each feature outweighed the benefit of gaining that
information.

#### 3.3.2.2 TME

A TME form (Appendix D) was used to assess progress towards goals that
were agreed by all those in the consultation. TME requires the
participants to agree on SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable,
Realistic and Time-bound) targets for the child related to any area of
difficulty, for example difficulties with using number bonds up to 20.
Using a 10-point Likert scale
[@likertTechniqueMeasurementAttitudes1932], the consultees judge where
the child currently is for the chosen area. A 'b' for baseline is
written next to that number. The consultees then predict where they
believe the child or young person will be in 6-8-weeks' time. They write
the letter 'e' for expected next to this number. After the specified
period, consultees then judged how much progress the child or young
person had made and indicated this by writing the letter 'a' next to the
chosen number.

TME was chosen because it is designed to fit in with the consultation
framework [@dunsmuirEvidenceBasedPractice2009]. Its streamlined nature
allowed it to be incorporated into the observed consultations with
minimal disruption to the flow of the consultation. This was valuable as
the EPs observed did not use TME as a typical step in their practice
currently, although they had in the past. Therefore, to preserve the
integrity of the observation, as little disruption by the research as
possible was sought. TME is a simple method to identify change for CYP
towards agreed goals and produces a single number. This can then be
included in the analysis of the identified features and what
combinations are present when change is judged to have occurred.

An issue with TME is that it is used as a tool to assess the efficacy of
consultation, but many events occur between the baseline and actual
rating. Many of these events will not be because of the consultation and
the implementation of interventions agreed in the consultation will
typical not be orchestrated by the EP
[@gutkinSchoolBasedConsultation1999], so how much progress can be
attributed to the consultation is unknown.

The reliability and validity of TME are also in question.
@dunsmuirEvidenceBasedPractice2009 state that the reliability of GAS has
been demonstrated, for example @kaplanUseAttainmentScaling1977.
@dunsmuirEvidenceBasedPractice2009 assume validity of TME if the goals
align with the recommendations from
@cardilloIllustrationsGoalSetting1994. However, reliability and validity
cannot be transferred from one measure to another, even if the latter is
derived from the former [@flakeConstructValidationSocial2017].
Researchers have also cautioned against using single-item measures for
constructs [@diamantopoulosGuidelinesChoosingMultiItem2012]. There have
also been recent analyses of the validity of GAS which judged that there
is "insufficient information to assess the validity of GAS"
[@gaasterlandSystematicReviewInvestigate2016, p. 19]. Therefore, the
suitability of TME to measure progress is called into question. However,
it was judged to be suitable because it allows the specification of
goals to the needs of individual participants. However, the strength of
the conclusions drawn on the effect consultation has on progress towards
the goals was reduced because of the concerns around validity and
reliability.

## 3.4 Procedure

Prior to data collection, it was decided the quantitative arm would be
conducted first, starting in March 2020 and continuing until March 2021.
Interviews would be conducted in the autumn of 2020. Thus, a concurrent
triangulation design was planned
[@creswellResearchDesignQualitative2003a]. Both the quantitative and
qualitative arms of the research would be conducted simultaneously and
independently. The results were to be compared to see whether the
conclusions drawn align with one another. This was done for practical
rather than philosophically informed reasons. It was agreed beforehand
that collecting observation data would be more difficult, as finding
consultations with all the required participants who were also willing
to be observed is unlikely. It was therefore felt that having a longer
window of opportunity to collect data was the reasonable course of
action.

However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all in person consultations were
cancelled across the UK to comply with the government-mandated lockdown
[@cabinetofficeStayingHomeAway2020]. Whilst many EPs offered
consultations to their respective schools, most found they delivered far
fewer consultations during the lockdown than usual. Those who delivered
consultations typically did so via telephone, eliminating any chance of
observation by the researcher. In response, data collection for the
interviews was brought forward to start in March 2020 and observations
of consultations would occur once consultations could be observed by the
researcher. The research was therefore adapted to use a sequential
transformative design [@creswellResearchDesignQualitative2003a]. This
type of mixed methodology involves one method preceding the other.
Either the qualitative or the quantitative arm of the research project
is conducted first. The methodology does not require one be used before
the other, so practical reasons may determine the order of research. The
results from both strands are interpreted together, with one informing
the other.

### 3.4.1 Interviews

Interviews were originally planned to be in person with EPs in the
researcher's EPS. However, because of the global pandemic, all
non-essential in person meetings were banned. They were therefore
switched to video or phone call interviews. This necessitated a choice
in video call technology. Because of the increased familiarity of the
public, ease of use, and improved security features
[@zoomReleaseNotesApril2020], Zoom was judged to be appropriate for the
purposes of this research. Because of the sudden increase in proficiency
and willingness of many EPs to use phone and video call technology, the
parameters of the participant recruitment for the interviews were
widened to all EPs. This decision was made because of a desire to
increase the number of participants and thus the range of views on
consultation. Informed consent was gained prior to participation (see
Appendix E).

Semi-structured focused interviews were used to elicit EP views with
regards to the core features of consultation, the features of an
effective consultation, the barriers to effective consultation, and what
is the unique contribution of consultation. Participants were
interviewed using a mixture of phone and video call technology. Data
collection took place between 31/03/2020 and 28/05/2020. All interviews
were recorded with an Honor 10 lite phone, and an anonymous transcript
made.

### 3.4.2 Observation

Observations were conducted between 20/11/2020 and 14/01/2021. After
gaining informed consent from all participants, the researcher observed
the consultation unfold as normal. The researcher used the observation
schedule to mark when and how frequently different features occurred. As
each feature was observed during the observation, a 1 was written in the
corresponding column of the observation schedule. This would continue
sequentially, with only one feature being recorded in each column until
the conclusion of the consultation. The features were then summed.

At the end of the consultation, the participants (EP, class teacher,
and/or parent) were asked to collectively identify 1-3 goals for the
child or young person. This was done using a TME form which the EP
introduced the participants to. Goals were suggested by the consultees
or by the EP (if the consultee was unable to think of a suitable goal).
It was then agreed by all participants. Participants rated, on a scale
of 1-10, where the child or young person currently was towards that goal
(by writing the letter 'B' for 'baseline' next to the number) and where
they expected them to be in 6-8 weeks (by writing the letter 'E' by the
number). In 6-8 weeks' time, participants would be contacted by the
researcher via email to rate how far along the child or young person had
progressed towards that goal. This judgement was represented by the
letter 'A' (for 'actual') along the same rating scale.

After six weeks had passed, contact was made via email with the
consultees. This was because it was judged to be sufficient time for the
participants to respond within the 8-week window recommended by TME
[@connorTargetMonitoringEvaluation2010]. All consultees responded within
8 weeks. For all but child 4, this period fell over the Christmas
holidays. The upper limit was therefore chosen to give the children as
great a time as possible in school receiving support. A second national
lockdown was announced prior to the start of the spring term 2021. All
children except child 3 remained in school during this lockdown.

## 3.5 Piloting methods

To ensure rigour in the methodologies employed, each method was piloted
prior to data collection. This was to check that the interview questions
were understandable and suitable and that the observation schedule
categories were discrete and easily interpretable.

### 3.5.1 Interview schedule

The interview was piloted with a Trainee Educational Psychologist to
check for flow and whether the interviewees understood the questions.
The TEP commented on the definition of "components" in question 5. The
word was changed to "features" and a clarification statement developed
to be provided in the interviewees, along with a definition if required.

### 3.5.2 Observation schedule

To establish inter-rater reliability (IRR), an anonymous transcript of a
previously recorded consultation was analysed for features using the
observation schedule. Three raters, including the researcher, assessed
the transcript for features of consultations sequentially. Intraclass
correlations [@shroutIntraclassCorrelationsUses1979] were calculated
between the three raters. The relative frequency of each category was
calculated for each rater and compared with one coder's (the
researchers) results. Because frequency counts were used, intraclass
correlations (ICC) were suitable as the data is continuous. To calculate
ICC, four factors must be decided upon prior to calculation
[@hallgrenComputingInterRaterReliability2012]. A two-way model was used
because the raters weren't randomly selected from the population. Given
that a non-timed sequence record design was chosen for the observation
schedule, good IRR was defined as consistency in the ratings because it
was more important that raters provide scores that are similar in rank
order. A single measures ICC was calculated because the reliability of
the other two raters needed to generalise to ratings of one coder (the
researcher). And finally, a mixed model was used because whilst the
findings want to be generalised to wider population, the raters were not
randomly chosen from a population and thus cannot be treated as random.
This model was applied using the irr package
[@gamerIrrVariousCoefficients2019] in the statistical programming
language R [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2017]. This produced
an ICC of 0.471 which, according to guidelines provided by
@cicchettiGuidelinesCriteriaRules1994 are 'fair'.

## 3.6 Data analysis

This chapter will detail the process of analysing both the qualitative
and quantitative data, including steps taken. A critique, with reference
to the relevant literature, of these methods will also be provided.

### 3.6.1 Interviews

The interviews were thematically analysed to explore RQ1 and its
sub-RQs. @braunUsingThematicAnalysis2006 identify 6 stages to the
process of TA: familiarizing yourself with your data; generating initial
codes; searching for themes; reviewing themes; defining and naming
themes; and producing the report. Codes were instances of features of
consultation discussed by the participants as this was the first step in
'data reduction' [@milesQualitativeDataAnalysis1994] by organising it
into meaningful groups [@tuckettApplyingThematicAnalysis2005].

#### 3.6.1.1 TA process

The anonymous transcripts were thematically analysed using the software
NVivo 12, a qualitative data analysis tool. This was done through
uploading the transcripts as text documents into the software. A mixed
or hybrid TA approach [@feredayDemonstratingRigorUsing2006] was
employed. This incorporates inductive and deductive TA. Inductive TA is
driven primarily by the data
[@boyatzisTransformingQualitativeInformation1998a] and deductive TA is
theory-driven with codes derived from said theory
[@crabtreeTemplateApproachText1992]. In NVivo, utterances by the
participants were highlighted and a deductive code was selected, an
inductive code was generated, or an inductive code was selected. As
such, the TA was "guided, but not confined, by the [deductive] codes"
[@feredayDemonstratingRigorUsing2006, p. 88]. The a priori codes
identified were developed from the scientific and Local Offer
literature. Inductive codes were either classed as 'features' of
consultation or 'what makes these features of consultation effective'.
For the features of consultation, inductive codes were either words used
by the interviewees that related to features of consultation that they
believed were effective or were features that shared a common idea. One
such example is "exploration" and "different perspectives" having the
core idea of discussing a topic from a variety of angles and gaining
'Different views'. For 'what makes these features of consultation
effective', these inductive codes were derived from interviewee
utterances relating to why they believed certain features of
consultation were effective.

To check the accuracy of codes and split previously identified inductive
codes into more fine-grained codes, the second stage in TA was repeated
three times. This iterative process forms a key part of TA
[@riceQualitativeResearchMethods1999] and should be methodological to
ensure rigour [@attride-stirlingThematicNetworksAnalytic2001]. During
the TA process, transcripts were regularly checked against the
recordings to ensure accuracy.

A thematic map of codes was created using TikZiT, an open-source project
for creating diagrams [@kissingerTikZiT2019]. This was to visually
represent all the codes and aid in the generation of themes.
@boyatzisTransformingQualitativeInformation1998a defines a theme as a
pattern contained within one's data which summarises the observations
through description. This helps to interpret the explored phenomenon.
Semantic themes (that which is explicitly said) were found and analysed
[@boyatzisTransformingQualitativeInformation1998a] with interpretation
of their significance and implications
[@pattonQualitativeEvaluationResearch1990]. TA identified 32 inductive
codes, as well as the 15 deductive codes, relating to what features EPs
believed were effective for consultation. 6 codes were identified for
what made said features effective (see Appendix F for the definitions of
the inductive codes, Appendix G for the definitions of the codes
relating to what makes the features effective, and Appendix H for the
breakdown of the number of interviews which each code was identified in
and the total number of codes for each feature). These were combined to
create 8 themes: Buy-in, Conditions, Context, Strengths-based, Shared
understanding, Intervention, Future facing, and EP skills and knowledge.
These could then be combined to create two overarching themes: Internal
factors (features relating to the factors endemic to a consultation) and
External factors (features relating to things happening around a
consultation).

There was no direct correspondence between the deductive and inductive
codes of the features of consultation to what makes those features
effective. This us because many interviewees talked in more general
terms as to why consultation was effective, rather than limiting their
focus to the discussion of specific features. Examples of thids include
"collaborative" and "clarity" rather than specific observable features.
However, some links can be made between them (see Appendix I) and the
codes relating to 'what makes the features of consultation effective'.

#### 3.6.1.2 Critique of TA

TA was chosen because it is flexible since it is not bound to a
phenomenological epistemology, such as methods like Interpretative
Phenomenological Analysis
[@smithInterpretativePhenomenologicalAnalysis2003]. Nor does it limit
one to only inductive code theme development and therefore the ignoring
of previously identified theory, such as Grounded theory
[@straussGroundedTheoryMethodology1994]. It is also described by
@braunUsingThematicAnalysis2006 as being "accessible" to those with less
experience in qualitative methods (p.81). Semantic themes were chosen
because the focus of this research is on the features of consultation
and how they relate to effecting change for the children or young people
the consultations are about. Therefore, an analysis of the "underlying
ideas, assumptions, and conceptualizations, and ideologies"
[@braunUsingThematicAnalysis2006, p. 84] was not deemed an appropriate
level of analysis.

However, because of the reduced depth of analysis performed during TA,
important themes and ideas could be missed. As it just describes the
data, it arguably has "limited analytical and interpretative properties"
[@eddlestonActionResearchStudy2016, p. 91]. This lack of depth gives TA
its flexibility, but it runs the risk of being biased which undermines
validity [@willigIntroducingQualitativeResearch2008]. To counter this,
all the data was made publicly available to allow independent analysis
and critique [@smithGuidelinesCleanData1986].

### 3.6.2 Observations

6 observations were conducted for 4 children. After the tabulation of
features of consultation using the observation schedule, the number of
features across each consultation was summed. Qualitative notes were
made on the demeanour and enthusiasm of the consultees. The data from
the TME forms for all goals was collected and a value of 'change' was
calculated for each consultation. This was done by subtracting the
'baseline' rank from the 'actual' as research suggests most TME forms
report a positive change because of the consultation
[@dunsmuirEvidenceBasedPractice2009; @monsenEvaluationPreTraining2009].
To explore the relationship between the presence of features and
reported change, Qualitative Comparison Analysis (QCA) was used, with
the QCA package for R [@dusaQCAComprehensiveResource2018]. QCA allows
the comparison of cases with the help of formal tools and with a
specific conception of cases [@rihouxCaseQualitativeComparative2009].

#### 3.6.2.1 QCA process

The foundation of QCA involves the identification of cases, conditions,
and an outcome. Each consultation forms a QCA case, the theoretically
derived features of consultation are the conditions, and the difference
between 'baseline' and 'actual' is the outcome. QCA involves the
analysis of the frequency of different conditions to explore which
combination of conditions (both presence and absence) led to a measured
outcome variable.

QCA is based on Boolean algebra and set theory. Conditions are
identified and can either be 'present' or 'absent' and sets are formed
based on combinations of these conditions being present or absent. QCA
flattens the data according to theoretically derived thresholds so
combinations of conditions can be compared. The final step of QCA is
Boolean minimisation where complex expressions of conditions which
produce the same outcome are reduced to simpler expressions.

#### 3.6.2.2 Crisp-set QCA

Crisp-set QCA [@raginComparativeMethodMoving1987] was used as the
features were mutually exclusive and bivalent; they could be classed as
either 'present' or 'absent'. After establishing the outcome and
conditions, @marxCrispSetQualitativeComparative2011 give the following
stages for crisp-set QCA:

1.  Convert the outcome and conditions into binary conditions.
2.  Code each case for each condition separately.
3.  Check the truth table for contradictory configurations.
4.  Analyse the model and interpret after deriving parsimonious
    solutions.

Given this framework, the raw scores were then calibrated so the
conditions were either classed as 'present' or 'absent' for each case
[@dusaQCAComprehensiveResource2018]. The threshold was defined as the
mean, which is one method suggested by @thiemCrispSetQCA2013 when
plotting the data does not provide clear thresholds or there is not a
theoretical justification for a threshold. Therefore, cases where the
number of observations of the condition was greater than the mean were
classed as 'present'. Cases where the number of observations of the
condition was less than the mean were classed as 'absent'. Any condition
which does not vary at all (either it is always present or absent) was
excluded as it is a constant
[@rihouxConfigurationalComparativeMethods2009a]. This creates a
dichotomous data table [@rihouxConfigurationalComparativeMethods2009a]
which can be non-formally analysed to explore patterns of conditions
relating to the presence of the outcome.

After this calibration, a truth table is created to systematically
examine the combinations of different causal conditions to the presence
or absence of the outcome
[@balodiConfigurationsEntrepreneurialOrientation2016]. A truth table
represents all the possible combinations of causal conditions seen in
the data. Each row is a distinct configuration and may contain one or
more case. Configurations can be classed as "1" (present), "0" (absent),
or "contradictory". Contradictory configurations (where the same
configuration of conditions leads to different outcomes) must be resolved
prior to Boolean minimisation. This is typically done by changing the
sufficiency inclusion cut-off point for the truth table to allow more
combinations of features, such that there aren't any contradictory
configurations [@dusaQCAComprehensiveResource2018]. Sufficiency for
inclusion is also calculated, which gives a score as to whether the
combination is sufficient for the outcome.

To establish whether a configuration can be combined, Boolean
minimisation is used. This can be summarised as: "if two Boolean
expressions differ in only one causal condition yet produce the same
outcome, then the causal condition that distinguishes the two
expressions can be considered irrelevant and can be removed to create a
simpler, combined expression" [@raginComparativeMethodMoving1987, p.
93]. This therefore provides the simplest combination of conditions from
the data which lead to the outcome.

#### 3.6.2.3 Critique of QCA

QCA is characterised as a "many variables, small N" approach
[@lijphartIIComparableCasesStrategy1975, p. 159] because it is used when
there are few cases but many potential causal variables. This makes it
suitable to analyse the potential causal features in relation to change
because there are a small number of observed consultations but a lot of
variables (features). QCA also does not require the researcher to
specify a single causal model, as is typical with most statistical
techniques. Rather, it allows the identification of "the number and
character of the different causal models that exist among comparable
cases" [@raginComparativeMethodMoving1987, p. 167].

QCA also allows for "multiple conjunctural causation"
[@rihouxCaseQualitativeComparative2009, p. 3] as different combinations
of factors can produce the same result. It can also
reveal causal asymmetry (configurations with the presence and absence of
the same condition leading to the presence of the outcome). Necessary
and sufficient conditions can be identified, as well as core and
peripheral conditions [@rihouxCaseQualitativeComparative2009].

# 4 Results

The subsequent chapter summarises the results from the two arms of the
thesis. The layout will follow the structure of the RQs, with the
interview data presented first to explore what interviewees believe are
the effective features of consultation. The observation data will then
be presented to gain an understanding of what features are seen in
consultations, which consultations saw change for the CYP, and which
features were necessary or sufficient for the observed change.

## 4.1 Interviews

The thematic map of codes and features (see Figure 1) was derived from
analysing the codes for similarities around their nature to give themes
[@braunUsingThematicAnalysis2006]. For example, the essence of codes
such as 'collaborative' and 'contributions valued' related to the
consultees viewing the consultation as a good use of their time and
believing that it would lead to change for CYP. This buy-in was linked
to the outcomes and suggestions from the consultation being realistic,
as consultees would be more likely to do what had been suggested and
believe it would have a positive impact. By treating the consultee as an
expert in their area of knowledge, this would help increase their buy-in
to the process of consultation and be more willing to engage.

EP skills and knowledge was identified as many of the effective features
of consultation were related to the EP having expert knowledge of viable
solutions or through their understanding of psychological models. These
all increased the efficacy of consultation. Through EP skill with
regards to their expert knowledge and ability to ask questions, for
example, consultation could be an efficient means to enact change.
Consultation also allowed for EP skill to be shown by being a flexible
model of working, such that EPs could a wide range of their skills and
knowledge to help CYP.

Shared understanding was identified as these features all related to the
gathering of different views to ensure everyone involved understood the
situation. This was aided through the EP using clear language and
documenting what had happened during a consultation.

Intervention as a theme related to the fact a consultation itself could
be an intervention. By actively changing the perspectives of consultees
in the consultation, change could follow from this. Consultation can
also be a vehicle to support consultees emotionally and therefore help
CYP through the emotional needs of core people in CYP's lives being met,
meaning they are better able to support CYP. Consultation was also
identified as being a part of the assessment process and as such is a
form of intervention.

Strengths-based was identified as a theme as three codes directly
related to building on the strengths of those involved and the child or
young person. This was through upskilling the consultees and reminding
them of the relevant attributes they already possess, as well as
highlighting what was already going well for the child or young person
and what strengths they have.

What follows is a more detailed description of each constituent code.

### 4.1.1 Buy-in

This theme related to the importance of EPs creating a bond with those
involved, including the consultee(s) and other school staff members not
directly involved in the consultation, and using this relationship to
facilitate change.

#### 4.1.1.1 Collaborative

One of the fundamental and most oft cited features for creating buy-in
was making consultation collaborative. Within the consultation, this was
achieved through a variety of factors. One of the key ones was making
sure there was equal participation, such that everyone had a voice and
different perspectives were heard: *"effective consultation shouldn't
being a meeting where one person dominates, whether that may be a
psychologist or anyone else"* (Interview 11) and *"it's like we're all
involved, we're all at the same level, we just come at it from a
different perspective"* (Interview 7).

If there is equal participation, there is a greater chance that everyone
involved has the same understanding of the situation and the child or
young person: *"to bring everyone together, and to co-create and
co-construct a shared narrative"* (Interview 11). Misunderstandings can
be cleared up (Interview 5) and this helps everyone feel involved in the
process and ensure that the consultation is collaborative. The creation
of a shared narrative can also include the creation of a shared agenda.
This helps guide the consultation so it is more effective as it is
meeting the needs of those involved and everyone agrees to it: *"I think
a really fundamentally important part of that consultation is ensuring
that we do have that shared agenda; we know why we're there together and
we all agree what we're doing there together"* (Interview 24) and *"to
arrive at a joint action plan, joint for the school and the parents,
school are always involved as well, so it's more collaborative"*
(Interview 10).

This shared agenda can be established by identifying what everyone is
hoping to get from the consultation:

> *...it would always start with a question about what are your best
> hopes from our meeting together? What are your best hopes from our
> work together? Because if we don't start with that question... then we
> don't know where we're trying to get to. (Interview 27)*

By working collaboratively with those involved, EPs can facilitate
collaboration between the home and school. This can potentially support
both by helping maintain morale and creating a sense of shared
responsibility:

> *...there is something that goes on often, not always, in the room
> when you've got the family, and school together, the, you do you do
> bring that sense of, 'We are working on this together; you are not
> alone school in this, you are not alone parents in this, we are doing
> this together'. (Interview 5)*

#### 4.1.1.2 Contributions valued

A related code, and one which can facilitate a collaborative
consultation, is the idea that everyone who is present in the
consultation should feel able to contribute. Not only this, but they
need to believe that what they say will be taken on board:

> *...where I would like to think that their views, their knowledge,
> their understanding is just as valid as mine... we are equal
> participants in this. (Interview 13)*

> *...equal participation... as far as possible, or that everybody
> participates and that everybody feels valued, everybody feels that
> what they had to say is useful. (Interview 20)*

This can help give power to those who may not typically have it in the
school environment, thus helping create a more level playing field and
therefore a more collaborative consultation: *"schools are by nature
very hierarchical. So if you've got a TA they're often not seen as the
same as... a SENCO or a head teacher's views but in that situation they
are".* (Interview 1)

#### 4.1.1.3 Encouraging engagement

Removing power dynamics within a consultation was seen by many
participants as an important part of the EPs role within consultation.
This formed part of the code 'EP encouraging engagement'. The EP must
try and create a space so no consultee feels intimidated and in which
all relevant people can contribute, even if they cannot physically be
present:

> *...the psychologist trying to level power dynamics is a really key, a
> really key part of any consultation and that... that's in relation to
> ourselves, as a professional with a doctorate normally, but also in
> relation to the family and the teacher, or the family and the school.
> (Interview 2)*

> *...balance of people's voices in the rooms. So... making time for
> those that might not be able to be present in the meeting to hear
> their views and voices. (Interview 27)*

This code related to any effort by the EP to attempt to include the
voices of the relevant parties. One of the ways that this is is achieved
is through *"active listening"* (Interview 1). A key idea related to the
EP facilitating others to participate:

> *I'm there to help facilitate the group in thinking about ways
> forward. (Interview 15)*

> *...giving a space where people can listen to other people's
> perspectives, then you take away the bulk of what it is that you're...
> using to try and make a difference. (Interview 21)*

Not only does the EP need to facilitate others, but also challenge
potentially harmful narratives and navigate difficult situations:

> *Being careful and being prepared to challenge. (Interview 25)*

> *...sometimes a... mediation role because... we work in complex and
> messy situations. And it's not always that people are going to agree,
> or even really want to hear what they have to say. So there's that...
> control in the, the floor that happens in a consultation, which
> doesn't happen in other types of conversation. (Interview 3)*

Being able to read body language was identified by a few EPs as being
important for facilitating engagement:

> *you try to do an online meeting, you lose the gesticulations, you
> lose... being able to point at things or being able to... look at
> their faces better and realise, 'Oh, they're not understanding, I need
> to change the way I'm explaining it' or something. I think you lose so
> much because it's that non-verbal feedback that you get, that allows
> you to know where you are at with the relationship, to know the way
> you can develop within that consultation. (Interview 24)*

However, this was not universal. A few EPs found that using
technologically mediated (tech) consultations did not lead to a decrease
in quality of the relationship. One EP experienced her consultees asking
for telephone consultations and that these were effective (Interview
16).

#### 4.1.1.4 Rapport

The difference between in-person and tech consultations relates to
another core feature, which is the development of a rapport with those
involved in consultations. Within the consultation, an EP must quickly
develop a rapport so that the consultees feel comfortable talking about
potentially difficult topics:

> *...trust and credibility and shared mutual respect, I think are at
> the core of any consultation. You know, they value what I offer
> because I'm in touch and the fact they get on well with me, that
> almost therapeutic relationship. (Interview 7)*

> *...built up that trust and sense of safety, that it's okay to express
> their worries, that you can get quite a lot of information. (Interview
> 10)*

The EP needs to not only develop a rapport with those involved but
encourage relationships between consultees: *"building attuned
interactions in a meeting with parents, with teachers, and then
hopefully between them as well. It just kind of gets everyone on the
same page, hopefully gets everyone pointing in the right direction"*
(Interview 30). This is especially important when relationships between
the home and school have broken down: *"sometimes you have a breakdown
between parents and the school... you can be a person in between, and
try and get that working through that... which is... a key feature of
consultation. (Interview 4)*

Several EPs talked about the importance of having a good relationship
with the school. A good relationship between the school (generally
understood to mean at least the SENCOs and potentially Senior Leadership
Team) helps consultation to be more effective: *"If it's going to be
successful model in a school, I think the need is... time for the EP to
build a relationship with the school is important.* (Interview 23). The
reason the relationship is crucial for improving consultation is that
when the EP has developed a good relationship with the school and they
are mutually supporting one another, it is easier to create an
environment which fosters collaboration:

> *...when you know the school especially, and they're supporting you in
> supporting the parents and the staff to do that, then you see it a lot
> more". (Interview 1)*

> *...schools are often hesitant to adopt consultation as the main
> method of EP work: some of the SEN schools that I work with have a
> very rigid way of seeing the EP role and what we do, and they're,
> they're view is, more often than not, my role as an EP is to go in, do
> an assessment, write a report, and that's it... so in those instances,
> I find it much harder to sell consultation as a, as a model.
> (Interview 11)*

However, several EPs spoke of using their relationship with the school
to change how they approach EP work and what the EP can do in the
school:

> *...once you build a relationship with schools, and you've been
> working in it, you can shift things, you can move things around, to...
> working with a bit more control, \> getting them to see how... it can
> be more effective, working with consultation, not doing just lots of
> assessments. (Interview 4)*

> *That's how you change it. I think that the relationship is super
> important. (Interview 23)*

#### 4.1.1.5 EP view of consultation and Consultee view of consultation

An important feature of consultation that relates to rapport is the
understanding that the consultees, EP, and school have towards
consultation. The conception EPs and consultees have of consultation
impacts on whether they buy-in to the process. If they do not see
consultation as a collaborative process, they are less likely to engage
with it in an effective way and believe it is a good use of their time.
How the EP and consultees view consultation can have a large impact on a
consultation and its efficacy. A belief shared by many interviewees was
that *"both parties... know how consultation works"* (Interview 24) and
this *"might depend on people's constructs of what consultation is"*
(Interview 29). Interviewees had an overwhelmingly positive view of
consultation, highlighting its versatility and alignment with their
values:

> *...consultation, I think, is a, is a framework with the complexity
> that matches the complexity of the concerns that are being raised...
> we're looking at concerns at an individual and a group and a systemic
> level. (Interview 21)*

> *I don't think you can be inclusive without using a consultative
> model. (Interview 25)*

Though many interviewees identified the value of consultation and the
importance of clearly understanding it and what it involves, many also
pointed out that there is a large heterogeneity of practice among EPs:
*"I think that concept of what a consultation is will vary from one EP
to another"* (Interview 24). There are also EPs who do not value it and
prefer a more traditional style of assessing CYP and then writing a
report. As one interviewee said: *"I know there's a lot of EPs out there
that continue to work in that way and I think, I think that's one of the
barriers to shifting more to a consultation framework"* (Interview 17).
One interviewee, who had recently attended a course on consultation
provided by their EPS, stated:

> *I'm not sure a lot of EPs really understand what it is. Being able to
> communicate that... even on that consultation course that I mentioned
> I went on, I was really surprised that people, people very open and
> very honest, and they said, 'We've been saying we've been using
> consultation, but we actually have not. We've realised now that we
> haven't really been using consultation'. (Interview 22)*

This makes it difficult for consultees to gain a clear understanding of
what consultation is and has led a few EPs to call for clearer
communication and *"being better at communicating... what it is and what
it can do"* (Interview 22). One of the reasons it is important
consultees understand what consultation means is so they can see the
value in it. Many interviewees described how some of the schools they
work in do not appreciate it fully:

> *...if I could click my fingers and change something on a systemic
> level, it would be the attitude toward consultation because I I really
> view them as an investment. If you invest in a consultation, you're
> going to get better work and and outcomes. Whereas, sometimes they can
> be viewed as an expensive hurdle you have to get over to get a
> standardised score. (Interview 2)*

> *I think there are some schools that... have a negative view of
> consultation. Because of that. It's, it's more complex procedure I
> think, people realise. (Interview 10)*

> *I think we need to educate our schools more about 'This is what the
> process is', because we say in sales blurb 'We do a consultation'
> and... and then the schools are still stuck in that... old way of
> thinking. (Interview 28)*

A recurring comment centred around the differences between primary and
secondary schools, with primaries typically being more willing to engage
with them:

> *...most primary SENCOs are very open to whatever I suggest. And
> they're quite open to different ways of working, as long as they have
> a report to use as evidence... for EP involvement, so it has that
> element of of a tick box. But most primary schools are very open to
> different ways of looking, I would say, but secondaries definitely
> aren't. (Interview 18)*

#### 4.1.1.6 EP view of EPs and Consultee view of EPs

Another relevant strand to the different perceptions of consultations is
how the consultees view EPs and their role. This relates to the theme of
Buy-in because if both or either party view the EP as the expert who
will fix the problem for the consultee, they will not buy-in to the
collaborative nature of the consultation. This threatens the efficacy of
the consultation. Several interviewees talked about how they were viewed
as gatekeepers to resources or as someone who would fix the situation
independently of any work by the consultees:

> *...the associations that staff or parents can have of us as being,
> kind of, the deciders of resources. So we will go in and we will say,
> and we will think we are there to support to think about what we can
> do for this child, and they will think we are coming in to say 'Yes
> you can have any EHCP [Education, Health, and Care Plan]' or 'Yes you
> can have extra money'. (Interview 1)*

> *...if school are new to that way of working and they are used to
> having an EP come in and... tell them what to do. I do notice that
> sometimes there's a bit of confusion... especially from some teachers
> who are, 'Why are you asking me, aren't you supposed to tell me what I
> need to do'? (Interview 11)*

The consultee view of EPs also affected how receptive a school is to
consultation because *"it very much comes down to the school's view of
my role"* (Interview 14). Several EPs talked about wanting to change the
views of the consultees in the consultation.

How the consultees view the EP can be changed in the consultation
itself: *"You're modelling how psychologists think... they might think a
psychologist is on a pedestal or whatever, but you're modelling that
psychologists are like everybody else"* (Interview 7). To help level
this power dynamic, EPs often try to present themselves as not having a
privileged position, as some interviewees talked about *"not putting
themselves in an expert position"* (Interview 27). This is because
*"It's the process of discussion itself... that leads to, kind of,
outcomes, rather than taking on an expert model."* (Interview 14).
However, a few EPs pushed back against the framing of the EPs non-expert
stance as it can be counter-productive: *"I think... sometimes EPs can
go too far the other way in not being the expert... it's a little bit
disingenuous, because sometimes we've got a lot of good ideas to offer"*
(Interview 27). How strongly they take on the role of the expert was
independent of the importance of most EPs placed on being empathetic and
supportive:

> *...you're in the situation as a human being, but also trying to be a
> psychologist as well, and they're quite difficult to do at the same
> time. (Interview 14)*

> *I think you need to be an ally, and a guide, but not be, 'I know what
> you should do and you should do this'. (Interview 23)*

#### 4.1.1.7 Willing to engage

A feature that almost two thirds of the interviewees identified was the
willingness of the consultees to engage in the consultation process:

> *...the effectiveness is because of engagement, critical thinking
> process thinking, and then plan your own action plans, which you're
> also engaged in. (Interview 5)*

> *...at the same time, to know that the reason that everyone is around
> the table for this consultation is to try and shift that thinking in
> some way. And usually... just by nature of showing up everybody does
> want that, even if they don't necessarily believe it to be possible,
> which is why I think those features of consultation are effective.
> (Interview 3)*

> *...just general engagement from either the parents or school, and the
> willingness to, to change; the willingness to change their practice.
> (Interview 5)*

#### 4.1.1.8 Consultee ownership

Several interviewees talked about how these features are effective
because they help create a sense of consultee ownership of the
situation. By being collaborative, the consultees are more likely to buy
into the process of consultation and are therefore more likely to feel
they can be an active agent in supporting the child or young person:

> *...when people are active participants in a process, any process,
> they would be more likely to follow through with what has been agreed
> in terms of, whether that would be actions, whether that would be a
> specific approach that needs to be put in place. (Interview 11)*

> *...they retain some sense of ownership and some... sense of
> responsibility for putting in place what comes next. (Interview 20)*

> *...the point of that conversation is to leave something behind for
> the people who actually have power to do things and if you don't have
> their buy-in, then it's totally pointless. I'm struggling to think of
> a method, outside of consultation, where you could get that buy in and
> that information share and get to any kind of meaningful endpoint.
> (Interview 3)*

#### 4.1.1.9 Realistic

Another commonly discussed mechanism for effective consultations was the
increased chance of realistic recommendations and outcomes being
established. If the ideas generated are more co-constructed and built on
shared knowledge, they are more likely to be feasible:

> *...it also allows for reality, so if you've... hopefully you're not
> getting ideas or strategies that are completely unworkable. So it
> should be based within the practice of the class teacher. So it
> isn't... somebody coming in and going, 'Well, you need to do this
> three times a day with... dah, dah, dah, dah, dah'. (Interview 21)*

> *...the feedback we get from parents that things are very grounded in
> reality, that the ideas that we're talking about makes sense because
> they come from a position of understanding and making sense of
> whatever is being brought into the room and... helping to manage some
> of the complexity. (Interview 27)*

If these suggestions are created collaboratively, then the consultees
are more likely to buy-in to the process of consultation and are more
likely to put in place the recommendations:

> *I think if you have a really good consultation and you can actually
> problem solve together, and the people that you're consulting with,
> actually come up with some of the ideas, then it's much more likely
> for those interventions to happen. (Interview 20)*

This greatly increases the chance of the consultation having a positive
impact for CYP.

#### 4.1.1.10 Consultees as experts

The final code from this theme relates to treating the consultees as
experts of their own area:

> *I try to make it collaborative because... my stance is that we all
> bring our own expertise; they're experts as parents, they're experts
> on their child... and as teachers, they're experts on... teaching that
> child and teaching in general. (Interview 8)*

> *I think they're effective because, we're capitalising on that idea
> that people are experts in their own lives. (Interview 22)*

If the consultees are seen as having valuable knowledge to bring to the
discussion, they are more likely to be an active participant in it. They
are therefore more likely to buy-in to the consultation and fully engage
with it, thus increasing the efficacy of the consultation.

### 4.1.2 EP skills and knowledge

The other most common theme related to the psychological knowledge and
skills EPs need to use when engaging in consultation.

#### 4.1.2.1 Knowledge

The most common code across all themes was in relation to the models of
consultation and general psychological knowledge that the interviewees
believed EPs needed to have to facilitate an effective consultation. The
*"use of theory and reference to the evidence base"* (Interview 2) was
identified as an important effective feature of consultation. Commonly
discussed models and frameworks included being solution-focused
(Interview 1), person-centred (Interview 16), trauma and attachment
informed (Interview 13), and using Wagner's model of consultation
(Interview 17) and the COMOIRA model (Interview 25). Other specific
psychological areas included using principles from Narrative Therapy
(Interview 17), an ecosystemic model (Interview 2), social
constructivism (Interview 6), as well as psychologies such as positive
psychology (Interview 9). Some interviewees saw their role as
*"sharing... and disseminating psychological theory"* (Interview 18) and
that consultation "helped [them] really use psychology with [their]
schools" (Interview 11).

The use of a model was often spoken positively as *"[giving] the
consultation a structure"* (Interview 11) and for one interviewee they
were the most important part:

> *...for me, the models of psychology are the number one priority, they
> have to be systemic and interactionist so that all behaviour is seen
> as a function of the person and the situation. So that if a concern is
> being described, we want to be looking at finding out about what was
> happening at the time or when it was happening. (Interview 27)*

The problem-analysis framework was named by one interviewee as their
main model of working (Interview 3). The core step of planning and
implementing interventions was mentioned by eight interviewees. One of
the key stages of Solution-focused approaches (suggesting solutions) was
explicitly mentioned by 11 interviewees and another key step (exception
seeking) was discussed by five.

#### 4.1.2.2 Presenting problem

Many EPs mentioned specific features within different models. One such
feature was exploring the presenting problem from the problem-analysis
framework [@monsenAccountableModelPractice1998]:

> *...getting an idea of what their main concerns are because when it
> feels very big, it's really the problem feels very big, the issue with
> the child is very messy. There's a lot going on, it can be hard to
> know where to start. So focusing them down is something that I do
> where I'm like 'What's your main concern?'. (Interview 8)*

This code also involved *"further clarification around the
difficulties"* (Interview 11) and a discussion of "What are the
conditions around it" (Interview 12).

#### 4.1.2.3 Interventions

Another code relating to the problem-analysis framework was the
discussion of interventions for CYP. This involved *"planning
recommendations"* (Interview 2) and using the consultation *"as a space
where we can really drill down into exactly what you mean when you say
'A social skills group'"* (Interview 2) as you can decide what the
intervention is specifically for.

#### 4.1.2.4 Suggesting solutions

Another frequently mentioned model was the Solution-focused model
[@murphySolutionfocusedCounselingSchools1997]. A key part of this model
is suggesting solutions and several interviewees brought this idea up.
These are typically recommendations *"to be done at home and at school"*
(Interview 12) Several EPs stated they were happy to make
recommendations but simultaneously did not want to dominate the
consultation (Interview 11). The importance of taking on board what the
consultees said was also voiced by a few interviewees so that the EP
does not make recommendations that have already been tried (Interview
13).

#### 4.1.2.5 Exception seeking

Another code relating to the Solution-focused model was the discussion
of times when the main difficulty is reduced or absent:

> *...building all those principles of, yes, psychology that we're
> trained with, and we're taught to use: exception seeking (Interview
> 24)*

> *...finding out about other contexts when it was similar and other
> contexts when it was different, so that you're able to hypothesise
> about what's happening (Interview 27)*

#### 4.1.2.6 Reflective

A feature mentioned by almost all participants centred around the
importance of being reflective. This included the use of *"reflective
listening"* (Interview 1) and *"[checking] back in with people...
working with them just to understand, have they progressed on that
journey"* (Interview 16). Many interviewees brought up the importance of
checking with the consultees *"whether we did what we wanted to do, and
if not, what still needs to be done?"* (Interview 21).

The importance of being reflective was not limited to within the
consultation; the structure of consultation itself should also
incorporate reflection:

> *...it might be nice within models that we have with schools, if
> there's a definite agreement that there is follow up or a review, if
> it's not by me, if it's by someone in the school, because that, that,
> kind of, ensures that what's discussed in the consultation is
> actually... implemented and monitored. (Interview 14)*

> *I also like to have a consultation as a feedback meeting at the end
> to... revisit what we've discussed in the first session, and
> obviously, by that time, I'll have gathered information from other
> sources to use that other information to further inform what is going
> to be done about the situation and to answer their referral question.
> (Interview 9)*

This reflective structure extends to the gaining of feedback from
consultees. The importance of feedback was mentioned by several
interviewees, for example: *"we have to treat it as a cyclical process
which has to be reviewed and evaluated so that we can use that feedback
to improve practices"* (Interview 1). Learning from peers through
observation and critical reflection with colleagues was also
highlighted:

> *I would hope that I'm a reflective practitioner and also... having
> other people observe consultation, is really helpful in terms of
> trying to figure out, sometimes, what's going on, what made a
> difference. (Interview 21)*

> *...peer supervision is really helpful in terms of... helping your
> practice because obviously, you've got all that shared... ideas and
> knowledge and bouncing off each other in the team. (Interview 9)*

#### 4.1.2.7 Questioning

The use of question was discussed by more than half the interviewees,
using questions like *"'I wonder what would happen if?' 'What do you
think might happen if?'"* (Interview 25) to explore possibilities and
develop understanding. More banausic questions are asked to explore a
situation to gain a fuller understanding (Interview 5) as well as
exploring the context (Interview 27). However, as the consultation
progresses, questions can be used to get the consultees to think about
what change would look like for the child or young person and how they
could go about achieving it (Interview 8). Not only is the content of
the questioning important, but the manner in which they are asked is a
key factor *"how EPs are asking those questions, and the types of
questions they're asking and... the timing of those questions"*
(Interview 15).

#### 4.1.2.8 Use of aids

A third of interviewees discussed types of supports that they use in
their consultations. Tools based on person-centred psychology, such as
Planning Alternative Tomorrows with Hope (PATH) and Making Action Plans
(MAPs), was brought up by Interviewees 16 and 17. The use of metaphors
was endorsed as means to safely explore difficult topics (Interview 12),
as well as *"the Japanese problem-solving fish" and "blob trees"*
(Interview 10).

#### 4.1.2.9 Preparation

Several interviewees highlighted the importance of being prepared for a
consultation, where the *"psychologist pools all that information,
formulates the hypothesis, types down what questions they want to ask"*
(Interview 20). This increases the chance of the consultation being
effective:

> *I think doing really thoughtful preparation is essential to to
> effective consultation, and I think sometimes there just isn't time
> for that but but really spending some time to think about... what,
> what do we know? What what do I, what am I hoping to get out of this?"
> (Interview 13)*

This preparation, of *"being in the right headspace yourself"*
(Interview 13) extends to the consultees as them not being prepared can
hamper the efficacy of a consultation:

> *I think for a lot of the time, what limits my consultations is,
> they're just... caug- maybe a teacher is... caught on the cuff, they
> weren't really expecting me to meet them there... but there they are.
> So they haven't really had time to... gather their thoughts
> beforehand. (Interview 20)*

#### 4.1.2.10 Reflexive

Another important feature of an effective consultation was the EP being
reflexive. This involves critically analysing, in the moment, *"'How's
my body language affecting the person that I'm speaking with?' 'How did
that question go down?' 'Was it understood?' Am I helping this
person?'"* (Interview 10). This process involves being *"flexible and
responsive"* (Interview 21) and *"adaptable"* (Interview 30) which can
be inhibited by the use of a consultation script (Interview 30). One
interviewee discussed the importance of:

> *...being aware of what's going on in the discussion and what the
> function of the discussion might be for the consultee at any one time.
> For example, if the adult is clearly struggling with the child, they
> might be looking for empathy... and understanding, so very much giving
> that but recognising that that in itself won't necessarily move things
> on. So trying to be aware... of what the function of their use of
> language is at the time and what they're trying to elicit from me.
> (Interview 14)*

Another interviewee discussed the importance of being sensitive to
*"anything that might be... difficult for potentially parents to talk
about"* (Interview 15). This process of being reflexive also helps
prevent the EP *"[imposing] my construct on the situation"* (Interview
25).

#### 4.1.2.11 Summarising

Several EPs mentioned that summarising or paraphrasing (Interview 19)
what has been said in a consultation is an important feature of
consultation. This includes *"re-speaking back to people what they've
told you"* (Interview 17) and *"[giving] a summary of what I think I've
heard from the different people"* (Interview 5).

#### 4.1.2.12 Efficient

The most frequently cited reason for consultation being effective was
that it is an efficient way of practising. This includes the simple fact
that *"more children get to have EP input"* (Interview 11) because it is
possible to *"talk about multiple students and put multiple things in
place as a result of that [consultation]"* (Interview 15). It is a tool
to *"gather information from different sources quickly"* (Interview 2)
which helps *"generate, hopefully accurate as possible, hypotheses"*
(Interview 30). Consultation also can *"effect change at a higher level
and a greater level"* (Interview 12) and there can be a *"ripple
effect... across policy level or across class or a group or even a whole
school"* (Interview 16). This means that "sometimes you might only need
one or *two consultation sessions to make some good change"* (Interview
17).

#### 4.1.2.13 Varied space for approach

Another key mechanism through which consultation is effective is its
versatility. *"Consultation is flexible"* (Interview 21) and a *"process
that evolves all the time"* (Interview 24). They allow for the use of
*"different strategies, different components"* (Interview 10) to meet
the needs of the consultees. Because consultation can be flexible, it
can adapt to a situation and therefore have a greater chance of a
positive impact:

> *I think the logistics of a consultation can remain the same, but the
> impact of a consultation can really vary. And... I don't know how many
> other tools we have available that that's the case for. So, if I think
> about the logistics for doing the BAS, or the logistics for doing a
> CBT session, I think that you very quickly become constrained by the
> way they were set up, whereas, the logistics for a consultation,
> getting some people in a room for a certain amount of time, allows for
> a flexibility. So... sometimes halfway through a consultation, you'll
> discover a piece of information that is crucial and up until now
> completely unknown, and you can change tack. (Interview 2)*

### 4.1.3 Shared understanding

This theme centres around the importance and ways in which EPs create a
common understanding of the situation between themselves and consultees.

#### 4.1.3.1 Different views

Almost every interviewee brought up the importance of gaining the views
of different people and *"gaining multiple perspectives"* (Interview
21). This includes *"the voice of the child, voice of the family, voice
of the teacher"* (Interview 17). It is particularly important to bring
the voice of the child or young person: *"being quite child centred...
bringing the pupil voice into that discussion... [as] it's often not
appropriate to have the student in the room, especially if they're
younger"* (Interview 15). A few interviewees talked about the importance
of gaining the views and including those with power in the system:

> *I think in some ways, as well, in consultation, making sure trying to
> involve, at some stage or at some level, people within a school or
> organisation who hold power. So that might be a head or a deputy head.
> Just because they have a lot of power within that system, to reframe.
> (Interview 17)*

> *...we are trying to become more active within the local authority as
> well. And I think that's very important. Because otherwise if you work
> as an EP service in isolation, without connects- strong connections
> with the senior leadership team within the local authority, and with
> the senior leadership team within the schools, nobody's gonna listen.
> (Interview 23)*

Consultation also allows for the *"understanding [of] different worlds
views, different cultural... constructs"* (Interview 17) and one
interviewee stated, *"when people start to tell stories of things, it
gives you some quite good insights into how they think and where...
they're stuck in their thinking"* (Interview 12). By gaining different
views from consultees, the EP is better placed to make informed
hypotheses (Interview 20). When there is a disagreement between home and
school, consultation is an effective vehicle to *"bring that...
discrepancy into the room and discuss it and see if we can come up with
it with a kind of compromise or a way forward that... meets the needs of
both parties, and particularly for the student as well"* (Interview 15).

#### 4.1.3.2 Information gathering

A related code was the EP gathering information not directly related to
the main concern: *"I find a lot out about the child, their background,
and... about the parents or family and what's going went around them"*
(Interview 8). This included *"[gathering] information from across the
four areas of SEND"* (Interview 2). This helps *"inform [their]
assessment"* (Interview 9). However, a number of interviewees made the
point that consultation is much more than simply gathering information:
*"the word 'consultation' might sometimes be interchangeably used with,
actually, what's really an information gathering process"* (Interview
24).

#### 4.1.3.3 Clarity

Over half the interviewees talked about the importance of gaining
clarity in a variety of ways. This included for *"what the process might
look like"* (Interview 20) as well as *"clarifying what people are
saying, what the parent is saying, what the SENCO is saying, what the
class teacher is saying"* (Interview 4). This done in the service of
*"understanding the situation better and exploring and understanding it
better"* (Interview 5). This allows for the EP to draw these strands
together and *"come to some kind of conceptualisation towards the end"*
(Interview 5).

#### 4.1.3.4 Setting out consultation plan

The establishing, by the EP, of the general structure for the
consultation was cited by more than half the interviewees as an
important feature of consultation. This was often done by exploring with
all those involved *"what we're hoping to get from the meeting, from the
consultation"* (Interview 24) because this *"gives it a clear
direction... [a] frame, [a] boundary"* (Interview 14). It also helps
*"[manages] everyone's expectations"* (Interview 14) and allows those
involved to know if they have achieved what they wanted to achieve
within the consultation (Interview 13).

#### 4.1.3.5 Language

Several interviewees brought up the importance of the language used
within a consultation. This had two main strands: potential language
difficulties due to English as a second language and the use of jargon
by the professional. One of the barriers to effective consultation is
*"lack of English language, from parents. It's not always possible to
have a translator... and even if you do... there are barriers... it's
difficult going through a third person. You have no idea... how
accurately they're translating"* (Interview 5). The other facet related
to the technical language that is pervades psychology and how this is
understood by the consultees:

> *It takes a much higher level of skill to have a meaningful
> consultation with somebody who does not have... the privilege of
> having... lots of education, and... [a] big vocabulary and high level
> of verbal skill, than it does... for us to sit around in a team
> surrounded by people who are educated to doctorate level... But when
> you really need to try and get meaningful information in a respectful
> way from from somebody who finds language very hard, that's... a
> whole... nother level of professional skill. (Interview 3)*

#### 4.1.3.6 Documentation

Documentation refers to the making of notes and summarising the contents
of the consultation. One EP stated it was *"[their] least favourite part
of the job... But unfortunately, it's really important, because I think
you've got an opportunity to write down and, kind of, what they call a
narrative, like rescue the words"* (Interview 17). Another expressed
more uniformly negative views towards documentation: *"what... will make
consultations: not having to flippin' write them up afterwards, we'd get
twice as many done... I don't understand why I'm writing about, the
magic happens in the room"* (Interview 22). However, others were more
positive: *"I think the written record is helpful of a consultation"*
(Interview 5) as it gives another opportunity to give advice at a later
date (Interview 30).

#### 4.1.3.7 EP explaining role

A small number of interviewees stated that making sure the consultees
understand what their role is within the consultation is important:
*"try and clarify what my role is and what it isn't"* (Interview 14).
This included *"[explaining] [their] involvement"* (Interview 14) and,
to help this process, one interviewee talked about *"[doing] role of the
EP insets, which we would offer every year, that talks about
consultation and the model of psychology and what's going to happen in
the meeting"* (Interview 27).

### 4.1.4 Intervention

Another theme which arose was the value of consultation as an
intervention in and of itself. This was done through three mechanisms:
providing a space for the EP to change consultees perceptions;
emotionally supporting consultees, and consultation being part of the
assessment process.

#### 4.1.4.1 Changing perspectives

One of the main ways in which interviewees talked about changing
perspectives was around *"extending the thought processes of the people
involved"* (Interview 10). A common idea among the interviewees was that
the consultation *"facilitates that process of developing new meaning
and new knowledge around a young person, or whatever the issue might
be... reframing the way that people see it, which I think is a key
element of change within consultation"* (Interview 17). The EP should
also help others *"not [think] about a problem within a child, but
[think] about a young person and how they interact with the environment
that they are in"* (Interview 13).

This change can also happen at a policy level, as one interviewee stated
that consultation was the best vehicle to help schools become more
inclusive (Interview 23). Consultation can also be used to help realign
people's priorities and view towards those involved. Because of the
highly pressurised nature of the systems we work in, *"family, and
school can quite often fall out of sync and having a conversation
together reminds everyone, they're on the same team"* (Interview 2).

This perspective change was not limited to the consultees views towards
the CYP or situation; it extended to their views of consultation itself.
One interviewee talked about how for *"[their] schools, once they were
introduced to [consultation], and once they tried it, they really liked
it"* and they could appreciate that *"consultation is a good model"*
(Interview 11)

#### 4.1.4.2 Supporting consultees

Another point many EPs made was that consultations can often be used to
help emotionally contain and provide support for the consultees:
*...there is also something about consultation with schools that I find
that can be emotionally containing for staff who perhaps are highly
distressed (Interview 13)*. These *"therapeutic benefits"* (Interview 2)
in a *"therapeutic style of meeting"* (Interview 22) often come through
high levels of *"acceptance and empathy"* (Interview 13) because often
consultees want to *"communicate with someone... how challenging it is
for them"* (Interview 17). However, this was an area in which a few EPs
judged that tech consultations were less effective as *"not being able
to be physically there, as the sounding board, as their containing
person... I couldn't be that... in a virtual environment"* (Interview
17)

#### 4.1.4.3 Assessment

A few interviewees saw the consultation as *"part of the assessment
process"* (Interview 3) and as a *"powerful way to carry out
assessment"* (Interview 19). This is because consultation can *"[lay]
the foundation for an application for an EHCP assessment"* (Interview
2).

### 4.1.5 Strengths-based

Another emergent theme centred around the focus of consultation: it
being strengths-based as it focuses on bringing out the skills of the
consultees, highlighting what work is already having a positive impact
for the child or young person, and discussing the positive qualities of
the child or young person.

#### 4.1.5.1 Empowering individuals

One of the key features of an effective consultation is *"helping people
to identify their own resources"* (Interview 10) and *"activate better
existing skills and knowledge and competence"* (Interview 13)

#### 4.1.5.2 What's already working

One aspect which was frequently discussed was the exploration of what
was already working for the child or young person. Interviewees talked
about "[trying] to build more of a strengths-based and positive outlook,
and look at what's working well, to shift things on" (Interview 22) and
"trying to find what has been tried, what has worked" (Interview 28).

#### 4.1.5.3 CYP strengths

The exploration of the strengths and positive qualities of CYP was also
mentioned by several interviewees, such as: "it's exploring skills and
competencies alongside the problem" (Interview 27). A common idea was
the consultations help reinvigorate the consultees and using the skills
they already have:

> *"... building on what they potentially knew, but didn't really know
> what to do with it and... empowering and recognising that they were
> potentially able to sort out themselves". (Interview 19)*

> *"... a decent consultation... can help them feel empowered and
> perhaps a little bit reinfused about what their role could be".
> (Interview 13)*

A related idea was the empowering of those the consultees engage with,
as a *"rising tide lifts all boats, in the sense that the person to whom
I can give the consultation will very often generalise the advice from
one case to another, from one session to another, from... one class to
another"* (Interview 7)

### 4.1.6 Future facing

The final theme of the super code Internal factors focused on the idea
of the consultation as helping to give a path forward for the
consultees. This included the creation of goals for the child or young
person and the nature of consultation helping to prevent problems for
other CYP in the future.

#### 4.1.6.1 Way forward

Over a third of the interviewees talked about how the nature of an
effective consultation gives consultees a structure for how to move
forward in supporting CYP: *"it provides a mechanism to think about the
future and to move forwards"* (Interview 15). Through consultation, the
EP can *"elicit change or move people forward in a positive way"*
(Interview 22) as well as identify the relevant support for CYP
(Interview 5). This is different from identifying specific goals for CYP
as consultations aren't *"always about solution finding because ways
forwards aren't always solutions"* (Interview 3).

#### 4.1.6.2 Goal setting

For almost a third of interviewees, the identification of outcomes for
CYP to work towards is an important feature of consultation:

> *"... for it to be consultation, I think there needs to be a clear,
> focus on finding, even if it's not a solution, but on coming up with a
> plan and... having a clear goal in mind". (Interview 11)*

> *"... [a] key component is goal setting, actually, and thinking about
> futures, and what the next steps would be". (Interview 17)*

However, one interviewee argued that not identifying clear goals does
not *"necessarily make it an ineffective consultation"* (Interview 3).

#### 4.1.6.3 Preventative

Because of the emphasis on upskilling consultees within consultations,
an EP using consultation can help prevent issues arising with other CYP
within the school:

> *"when you're working with a teacher or with families or with
> different staff, actually the learning might be, the focus might be
> around a specific child, but actually that learning and that reframing
> can then be taken and be used preventatively with other young people
> or in the classroom" (Interview 17)*

By using consultations in different ways, such as regular features of
school life, *"they would become more preventative"* (Interview 14).

#### 4.1.6.4 Ideas for future EP work

A few interviewees brought up the importance of using consultations to
talk about and negotiate future EP involvement regarding the child or
young person (Interview 24). This might include an observation of them
in class (Interview 4).

### 4.1.7 Conditions

The first theme of the super code External factors related to the
conditions of the consultations, including who was involved, how much
time was set aside for the consultation, and the space in which it was
held.

#### 4.1.7.1 Key people

Almost every interviewee cited having *"all the key stakeholders"*
(Interview 11) involved in the consultation as a key aspect.
Consultation was widely regarded as an *"indirect service method"*
(Interview 17) so involved working with a range of people, including
*"the SENCO, the class teacher, and both the mum and dad of that child"*
(Interview 11). Many interviewees state that it was crucial to have
*"the person that has most knowledge about the child"* (Interview 10) or
the *"people who are most concerned"* (Interview 21). This included the
person who *"has the most influence"* (Interview 14) as they will be the
person who will implement the agreed interventions.

A number of interviewees highlighted the importance of bringing the
voice of the child or young person into the consultation, either by
actively involving them in the consultation (Interview 21) or through
those that know them well (Interview 15).

Many interviewees identified difficulties with conducting consultations
in secondary schools:

> *...if you've got multiple people working with a young person, and
> actually the more people you have, the less anybody feels any
> responsibility for them... you're trying to find that person who is
> most concerned and actually they don't exist. (Interview 13)*

> *...it's very difficult to get parents, teachers, parents and teachers
> around the same table, at the same time. (Interview 18)*

#### 4.1.7.2 Time

Over two thirds of the interviewees brought up time as an important part
of a consultation. This mainly took the form of interviewees stating
that the biggest barrier to effective consultations was a lack of time
within the consultation, for example: *"I don't think you can have, say
an, effective 20-minute consultation. It's not a consultation"*
(Interview 26). This is because you need time for those involved to move
beyond the "black and white way of thinking" about labels (Interview
18).

A related issue centred around the amount of time bought in by schools.
Because the majority of interviewees either worked for fully traded
services or as private EPs, the schools they worked with only had a
limited amount of contact time. This led to several interviewees
discussing the difficulty of bringing about change with schools because
of the time limits placed on them (Interview 12).

This was an area where tech consultations provided an advantage, as EPs
can save time by not travelling between different schools (Interviews
13, 17, & 29).

#### 4.1.7.3 Resources

Resources was often cited important feature to consultations. This had
several dimensions, including the ability of the consultees to enact
change for CYP due to resource constraints:

> *The biggest barrier I come across is people saying, 'Well, that's
> lovely and I think we've come up with some fabulous ideas. However, I
> don't think management will let me do that'... So top-down
> squashing... it's budgetary, it's time-bound, it's people saying,
> 'Well, we don't have the physical resources to be able to do that'.
> (Interview 16)*

> *... we might have all the ideas in the world around how someone might
> be supported. And it doesn't, I guess, affect the consultation in
> itself so much but it affects, it does affect the type of dialogue we
> might have around, schools and just the lack in, the workforce, the
> lack in staff, they're lacking the resourcing to really support some
> of these young people in the way that we would like them to be. I
> think that shapes consultations. (Interview 17)*

Another dimension is the resources school have to allow staff the time
off from lessons to fully engage with a consultation: *"schools thinking
'We don't have the time and the capacity to free up staff to come and,
come and sit and have a consultation'"* (Interview 15).

A third dimension related to the resources available to the schools to
buy in EP time:

> *... I've certainly got schools that repeatedly say to me that they
> would love more EP time but they can't afford it in a traded
> environment and lots of... competing things that they have to spend
> money on. (Interview 21)*

#### 4.1.7.4 Space

A number of interviewees identified the importance of creating a space
for effective consultations to occur. This encompassed both the physical
space of the location and the mental space to be able to deal with
complex experiences:

> *... sometimes people have asked to do consultations in rooms where
> there are other people and it's just messy. (Interview 2)*

> *I think the room that you meet in is quite important and the way that
> it's set up... so... it doesn't seem like an interview situation.
> (Interview 9)*

This aspect is particularly important for tech consultations as these
almost always occur in the EP's and consultee's home:

> *... it can be difficult for staff to really, and parents, to really
> engage with the process, if they've got children running around and
> things going on. So... doing it where they can't have a separate
> space, emotionally as well as physically, can be tricky. (Interview
> 14)*

> *... having to make sure that doors are secure, so children can't run
> in at particular points. (Interview 24)*

#### 4.1.7.5 Confidential

Several interviewees brought up the importance of confidentiality for
what was discussed in the consultation: *"we want to have a confidential
place to reflect"* (Interview 22). This helps *"contribute towards
building that kind of environment where people feel happy to share"*
(Interview 15). The importance of confidentiality was made more
important for many interviewees by the unexpected transition to tech
consultations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with several
identifying issues around security, for example: "the first step is
finding an effective platform that's got enough safety features for us
to be able to... carry out a consultation" (Interview 10).

### 4.1.8 Context

The second code within the External factors overarching theme was
related to the general context that consultations are conducted within.

#### 4.1.8.1 Education systems

EPs work within many systems. These can all impact on individual
consultations and on how EPs work through consultation. For example,
*"there are schools who don't particularly value [consultation] and just
want us to do assessments"* (Interview 5). As one interviewee stated,
*"all the work of the EPs is determined by the context in which it's set
and by the organisational agendas in which it's set"* (Interview 10).
Several interviewees talked about the bureaucracy of the education
system impacting on consultations and EP work as a whole:

> *...[the] role of the EP is less problem solving, it's more ticking a
> box, more bureaucratic exercise rather than a solving facilitation.
> (Interview 10)*

> *...there is a bureaucracy around an education, health care plan, in
> terms of certain reports being written, certain hurdles being gone
> through and certain assessments taking place. And so... we're not
> doing any thinking, we're merely following a bureaucratic process.
> (Interview 6)*

Other wider systemic issues related to how society as a whole sees
additional needs:

> *...the medical model is so predominant... And I often find that those
> explanations for, learning and development and behaviours, can
> dominate conversations... ADHD, ASD... they are definitely a barrier
> to creating more effective, positive change. (Interview 17)*

> *...there's enormous pressure, ever increasing pressure on schools, to
> get results. And... [that's] antithetical to consultation. (Interview
> 25)*

A number of EPs identified operating in traded services as a barrier to
consultation:

> *...I feel like it's the situation in which we work, the whole traded
> model, which means that consultation is, an addition... we just have
> to do it to get the information. It's not... valued as... a way of
> working in and of itself. (Interview 8)*

> *...I find within a traded service, you're quite constricted, in lots
> of ways about what the school expect in terms of the use of your time.
> (Interview 9)*

> *...I feel like... particularly in the traded service model, that
> dynamic is really hard to manage. And... it's been a real difficulty
> to introduce consultation as a working modelling in many of my
> schools. (Interview 11)*

Another issue that was identified was the views that school staff had
towards change because of the people with more power in the system:
*"SENCOs feeling unable to make change because of the head teacher"*
(Interview 23).

#### 4.1.8.2 Individual differences

Almost five sixths of the interviewees brought up the characteristics of
those involved in the consultation as an important feature of a
consultation. The personalities, histories, and on the day mood of the
consultees will likely impact on a consultation:

> *... that's going to play out in the room, in different ways,
> depending on the circumstances, the resilience of individuals,
> position, their own history, etc, etc. And will play out differently
> day to day, with the same people. (Interview 25)*

> *... there are parents who just don't like coming into school, are
> barred from school... have such a difficult relationship with school
> that is not possible. Physically can't get there because of health
> issues or younger children. (Interview 5)*

> *I think there's always going to be a level of... personality
> involved, that with some people, it is easier to... get that...
> feeling of engagement higher than it is with others... I think there
> is some variability, just because of human nature and the different
> personalities of the people that you meet. (Interview 12)*

The personality of the EP was identified by a few interviewees as
potentially impacting on a consultation, for example: *"I think the
personality of the individual EP can have a big impact"* (Interview 24).
EP confidence in their own skill and knowledge was also identified as an
important feature (Interview 14).

This variability in the presentation of consultation was viewed as a
potential negative for consultation; if a teacher or parent was told
they had to attend a consultation they *"wouldn't know what to expect
because it would depend so much on the individual"* (Interview 11)
because *"everybody has gone on their own and done totally different
things"* (Interview 23).

#### 4.1.8.3 Understanding of SEN

A few interviewees stated that the way a school understands additional
needs within an education context can have an impact on consultations.
Some schools cleave to a more traditional 'within-child' understanding
of additional needs, particularly secondary schools (Interview 14). As
such, it is much harder to encourage these schools to adopt consultation
as a way of working (Interview 11).

#### 4.1.8.4 EP workload

Almost a third of interviewees identified the amount of work EPs
typically do as being a barrier to effective consultations. This was
because the volume of work prohibits being able to fully engage with a
case:

> *... when you are on the day job, and you are 24-7 doing EP stuff, and
> you have... a stupid amount of cases and a stupid amount of schools
> and you cannot think... you are running on... empty (Interview 23)*

> *... you're so tired and stressed... you're not really thinking as
> well... you can't reflect on it and come up with different ideas and
> solutions because... you just have to get that written, get it sent
> off, and get on to the next thing. (Interview 9)*

One interviewee identified the positive benefit of moving to tech
consultations because *"I have a lot more time in my day, which means
that I actually have a lot more space to think about children and
cases"* (Interview 18).

#### 4.1.8.5 School knowledge

A few interviewees stated that having *"in depth knowledge of schools
and how they work"* (Interview 7), in particular secondary schools
(Interview 22), helped their consultations be more effective. One
interviewee explained that having good knowledge of the whole system
differentiated EPs from clinical psychologists because EPs are
"fluent... in that... understanding and situational context" (Interview
21).

#### 4.1.8.6 Outside system

Almost a third of interviewees stated that the EP working outside the
school system helped their consultations be more effective. This was
through a few mechanisms. The first related to the ability of an outside
agent to ask potentially difficult questions:

> *I think being an external person helps... you are able to ask some of
> the questions of parents that school can't, you can also ask questions
> of school that parents [can't] and take on that more challenging
> aspects. (Interview 5)*

The second related to the benefit of not becoming overly fixated on or
held back by potential negative events and perspectives within the
system:

> *... we have to get meta to the situation and not get too bogged down
> and immersed in the nitty gritty. So keeping meta and keeping
> perspective on it, I think is a skill that EPs can bring, that really
> helps. And that's the beauty of not working in the system, is the
> beauty of going in and out of schools. (Interview 27)*

## 4.2 Observations

The quantitative half of the research involved the observing of 6
consultations with the features identified by the researcher. 10 goals
were agreed across the consultations. Progress towards agreed goals were
then calculated through TME forms and the relationship between the
observation of features and progress was calculated using QCA.

### 4.2.1 Features

Table 1 summarises the cumulative frequencies of each feature for each
consultation. The most frequently observed feature was Understanding the
presenting problem, followed by CYP strengths, and then Info gather. 3
features were observed on zero occasions (School knowledge, EP
explaining role, and Planning/implementing interventions). Understanding
the presenting problem was observed the most frequently in every
consultation, often twice as frequently as the next most observed
feature. CYP strengths was the next most frequently observed, followed
by Information gather.

### 4.2.2 Qualitative description of consultations

The first consultation was a joint home-school consultation with the
child's teacher and parent. Both consultees were receptive from the
beginning and engaged with the consultation. For the final 10 minutes,
the parent had to leave to go and pick up another child. Whilst they
were present in the consultation, their attention was diverted as they
were driving. It was during this time that the goals for their child
were agreed.

The second consultation was a teacher consultation for child 2. The
teacher was engaged from the start of the consultation but was very
stressed due to overwork and stated this during the consultation. When
the topic of identifying goals for the child was brought up, they
started crying. This was because of the perceived pressure of another
metric (which they believed would show no progress for the child) and
they had to be emotionally contained by the EP. After being supported,
they were able to identify one goal for the child.

The next consultation was for the parent of child 2. They were attentive
during the consultation and fully engaged for its entirety. With support
from the EP, they identified three goals for their child.

The consultation for child 3 was a parent consultation. They gave their
full attention to the consultation and was joined by their partner for
the final 20 minutes, who also fully engaged. The parent identified one
goal for their child.

The first consultation for child 4 was with the child's teacher. In this
consultation, the EP used the Cognitive Abilities Profile
[@deutschCognitiveAbilitiesProfile2009]. This is a framework based on
Dynamic Assessment [@feuersteinLearningPotentialAssessment1995] which
seeks to explore "identify patterns of cognitive strengths and
difficulties and then jointly plan, intervene and systematically monitor
progress" [@deutschCognitiveAbilitiesProfile2021]. The consultee was
engaged throughout and at the conclusion of the consultation identified
one goal for the child.

The second consultation for child 4 involved the child's parents. They
gave their full attention, although one expressed frustration at having
to repeatedly explain their child's needs to different professionals.
They identified one goal for their child.

### 4.2.3 TME data

Ten goals were identified for the four CYP. Table 2 summarises the goals
for each child and with whom the goals were created. It also shows what
baseline rating was given, the expected value 6-8 weeks later, the
actual rating, and the corresponding progress for the CYP. Appendix J
presents all TME ratings in a line graph
[@wickhamGgplot2ElegantGraphics2016]. There was one unit of reported
change for six of the ten goals. One goal (from the parent of child 2)
was judged to have made two units of progress since the baseline rating.
Regarding the three goals which were judged to have not made progress,
two were given by the parents of the children and one by the teacher.

In relation to goals between consultees for the same child, there was no
consistency. Two goals were shared across both teacher and parent (child
1 and child 2). For child 1, the teacher stated they had progressed from
a '3' to a '4' regarding their ability to accept play requests from
other children. The parent of child 1 did not believe they had made
progress over the 8 weeks, though they agreed with the baseline and
expected rating. For child 2, the teacher judged they had not made
progress regarding their ability to name their emotions without pausing
for an extended period of time (remaining at '3'). The parent stated
that child 2 was at a '5' at baseline and had progressed to a '6' eight
weeks later.

#### 4.2.3.1 Child 1

The joint home-school consultation for child 1 identified two goals,
with one being judged by both parent and teacher and one by only the
teacher[^1]. Child 1 was judged to be at a '3' for the baseline for all
their goals. The expected change for the goals was two or three points
greater. The actual progress after 8 weeks was judged by their teacher
as being one for both goals. Their parent judged they had not made any
progress on the identified goal.

[^1]: The parent did not judge the second goal because they stated they
    did not understand what the goal meant.

#### 4.2.3.2 Child 2

For child 2, there was a teacher consultation followed by a parent
consultation. Their teacher identified one goal and rated them currently
at a '3' and expected to rate them as a '7' in 6-8 weeks' time. 8 weeks
later, their teacher rated that no progress had been made. Their parent
identified three goals for them. They rated the baseline for two of the
goals as '5' (one of which was the shared goal with the teacher) and one
of them as '3'. They expected to rate their child as '8' in 6-8 weeks'
time for the goals with the baseline of '5' and at '5' for the goal with
a baseline of '3'. The actual progress was one for the shared goal, two
for the second goal with a baseline of '5' and one for the goal with a
baseline of '3'.

#### 4.2.3.3 Child 3

Child 3 had only a parent consultation and one goal identified. They
were given a baseline of '3' and were expected to be rated at a '4'. 8
weeks later, the actual rating was a '3', showing no progress.

#### 4.2.3.4 Child 4

Child 4 had a teacher consultation and a parent consultation. One goal
was identified for each, although they were different. The teacher gave
the child a baseline of '2' and an expected rating of '4'. 8 weeks
later, they rated child 4 as a '3', thus showing a change of one. The
parents gave a rating of '3' for a distinct goal (emotion regulation)
and an expected value of '5'. The actual rating given was '4', also
showing a change of one.

### 4.2.4 QCA

To gain a deeper understanding of which combination of conditions lead
to change, crisp-set QCA was performed for each goal. Therefore, the
results from consultations with more than one goal were duplicated to
allow analysis for the individual goals. The first step of QCA
necessitated the flattening of the data so the features and change were
either classed as 'present' or 'absent', The mean was used as the
threshold as there was no theoretically justified threshold. Features
which were not observed once were removed.

#### 4.2.4.1 Calibration

Table 3 shows the calibrated table of features. After calibration, EP
using expert knowledge was the most frequently occurring feature.
Suggesting solutions and Information gathering were the next most observed
features. For the parent consultation of child 2, because the number of
times each feature was seen was below the mean, no features were classed
as present. However, change was judged to have occurred for each goal.
For the other goals which recorded change, three contained EP using
expert knowledge, Suggesting solutions, and Information gathering. Two
contained Empowering individuals, Setting out the consultation plan,
Everyone's contributions valued, and CYP strengths.

#### 4.2.4.2 Truth table and Boolean minimisation

To further reduce the complexity of the data, the calibrated table was
converted into a truth table where cases with either identical
conditions or cases with one condition different were collapsed. This
produced Table 4. Table 4 shows the combination of different conditions,
whether change was observed or not (Outcome), the number of cases which
this combination corresponds to (n), the sufficiency inclusion score
(incl), and the cases which are included within this combination
(cases). There were no contradictory configurations. The sufficiency
inclusion score of 1 indicates that this combination of features is
necessary and sufficient for change. The score of 0.66 suggests this
combination is not as strongly necessary or sufficient for change (as
only two of the three cases or 66% saw change).

Boolean minimisation was then performed on the truth table to
demonstrate the simplest combination of conditions which were sufficient
for change to be observed. This led to three combinations (see Appendix
K for breakdown of the combinations and the cases they correspond to).

The first combination of features which was sufficient for change was
the absence of Empowering individuals, the absence of Ideas for future
EP work, the presence of Setting out the consultation plan, the absence
of the EP using expert knowledge, the absence of summarising what has
previously been said, the presence of Understanding the presenting
problem, the absence of Everyone's contributions valued, the presence of
Discussing what already works, the absence of CYP strengths, the absence
of Suggesting solutions, and the presence of Information gathering. This
corresponded to the teacher consultation for child 4. This suggests that
the EP establishing the consultation plan at the beginning of the
consultation is important for helping bring about positive change for
the CYP. During the consultation, exploration of the presenting problem
and what is already working for the CYP, as well as the EP gathering
more information about a range of topics, is sufficient for change to be
seen. It also suggests that the EP not valuing the contributions of
those involved or not empowering individuals does not prohibit change.
This is also true for the EP using their expert knowledge or suggesting
solutions, as the absence of these features were also calculated as
being sufficient for change.

The second combination sufficient for CYP change corresponded to the
parent consultation for child 4. Said combination of features was: the
absence of Empowering individuals, the presence of Ideas for future EP
work, the presence of Setting out the consultation plan, the presence of
the EP using expert knowledge, the presence of Summarising, the absence
of Understanding the presenting problem, the absence of Everyone's
contributions valued, the absence of Discussing what already works, the
absence of CYP strengths, the presence of Suggesting solutions, and the
absence of Information gathering. This again suggests that establishing
the plan for the consultation at the beginning of the consultation is a
valuable feature. Over the course of the consultation, discussing
potential ideas for work the EP can do in the future is an important
feature. The EP using their expert knowledge, as well as summarising
what has been said by the consultees and suggesting solutions for the
presenting problem were sufficient for change. This combination also
suggests that the EP not empowering individuals or valuing everyone's
contributions did not stop progress from being recorded. A lack of
discussion of what was already working and the strengths of the CYP, as
well as exploration of the presenting problem, did not impede positive
change being observed for the CYP.

The third and final combination, which came from the parent consultation
for child 2, was the absence of all features. This result was seen
because the calibration of the features. Given that this consultation
had a relative low number of recorded features, calibration led to it
being classed as having no features present.

# 5 Discussion

This chapter explores the findings from this piece of research with
regards to the research questions, with links to the extant literature.
The aim of this study was to gain insight into the core features of an
effective consultation. This was done through interviews and
observations of real-world consultations (combined with statistical
analysis of theoretically derived features). To evaluate this aim, the
RQs in relation to the results were explored, followed by a critical
analysis of the research. Implications for the EP field are discussed
and suggestions for future work informed by this research are provided.
Researcher reflections on the process and conclusions are also detailed.

## 5.1 Discussion of findings

This section identifies the RQs and details the relevant strands of the
results to allow analysis of them. Due to the large wealth of data, it
is not within the scope of this thesis to provide exhaustive analysis of
each code. Given this, key codes and ideas are drawn out and analysed.

### 5.1.1 What are the core features of an effective consultation?

To answer this RQ, it was divided into three sub-RQs which allowed
analysis of this question in finer detail. This was done through
interviews and the explicit views of EPs.

#### 5.1.1.1 What do EPs believe are the key features of an effective consultation?

The 8 themes regarding the core features of consultation encapsulate a
very broad range of aspects of consultation that a number of EPs (of
varying levels of experience) believe are important for making
consultation effective. The most frequently identified themes were
Buy-in and EP skills and knowledge. There was a large disparity between
the number of inductive and deductive codes. There was also a difference
between the number of instances for each type of code, with the
inductive codes being recorded more frequently than deductive codes.
This suggests that the current literature does not accurately reflect
EP's beliefs about effective consultation.

##### 5.1.1.1.1 Buy-in

Buy-in referred to all the participants of the consultation, including
the EP, believing that consultation is an effective method for enacting
change for the child or young person in question. Believing that this
was a valuable use of their time and that it could help the child or
young person was believed by many interviewees to be essential for an
effective consultation. Without this buy-in, consultees would not be
willing to engage with the process or change anything as a result of the
consultation. And if nothing changed, it is unlikely the situation would
improve for the child or young person, and it is even less likely the EP
could have a positive impact through consultation
[@noellResearchExaminingRelationships2014].

This buy-in could be established at two time points: prior to the
consultation and during the consultation. Before the consultation, the
consultees view of consultation had a large impact on whether they
valued the process. If they understood what it was (via explanation or
training) and believed that it could help, then the chances of the
consultation having a positive impact improved. If they understood that
they were an active member of the consultation and did not look to the
EP as the expert who would fix the problem for them, then they could
buy-in to the process and an effective consultation was more likely to
occur. @hasselbuschWorkingTogetherOccupational2008 found that
consultants being perceived as the expert was felt to have a limiting
impact on the efficacy of the consultation and many participants shared
this view. Buy-in was also facilitated by the EP not viewing themselves
as the expert who was there to tell the consultees what they needed to
do to solve the problem. Thus, prior to the consultation, buy-in for
both the consultees and EP could be established through these
mechanisms.

During the consultation, buy-in by those involved could be facilitated
by the EP. By being collaborative and actively involving the consultees
in the consultation, the EP could encourage their buy-in to the process.
By giving the consultees the opportunity to voice their opinions and
concerns and listening to them, this helped the consultees feel valued
and an active participant in the process
[@bennAnalysisInstructionalConsultants2008]. Consultee voice has been
identified as crucial for effective consultation
[@newmanQualitativeMetasynthesisConsultation2017] and these results
further substantiate this idea. These all served to help create a
rapport between the EP and consultees. This relationship was one of the
most important features of an effective consultation, as without a
trusting relationship between consultees and the EP, consultation cannot
be an effective vehicle for change [@meyersQualitativeMixedMethods2014].
Rapport also formed the foundation for many of the ways consultation
helped consultees, such as through changing consultee perspectives. This
buy-in also greatly increases the chance of solutions being implemented,
which is one of the main mechanisms through which consultation creates
positive change [@meyersQualitativeMixedMethods2014].

##### 5.1.1.1.2 EP skills and knowledge

This theme related to all the ways that EPs use the knowledge gained
over the course of their training and professional practice. It has been
argued that "[possessing] expert knowledge and skills in the field of
educational psychology theory and practice is one of, if not the, most
important requirement for effective consultation
[@farrellReflectionsRoleConsultation2015]. This is reflected in the
results, as every interviewee mentioned at least one example of expert
knowledge they used in their practice. In addition, many explicitly
talked about the importance of this knowledge for effective
consultation.

Specific examples of this knowledge included core models of
consultation, such as Patsy Wagner's model of consultation, as well as
Jey Monsen's Problem-analysis framework.
@meyersQualitativeMixedMethods2014 argue that effective consultation
requires steps such as "problem definition" and other core parts of the
Monsen framework. Several interviewees cited the Problem-analysis
framework as their primary model and a core part of an effective
consultation. However, few interviewees stated they strictly held to any
one model. Many stated they used different elements from different
models as and when appropriate. This paints a picture of consultation,
as used by EPs, as an assortment of different skills and knowledge
rather than strict adherence to one method. To date, there has been no
examination of the efficacy between consultations when there is strict
adherence to the model versus a more eclectic mix. It is therefore
unknown whether this approach to consultation is as effective as
strictly using a consultation model.

Another common model of consultation, Solution-focused approaches, was
frequently mentioned and several EPs gave specific examples of tools
they use, such as the miracle question and looking for exceptions.
However, these individual tools were mentioned less frequently than
references to the whole model. There is therefore potential uncertainty
as to whether interviewees who state they use solution-focused
approaches do so in the same way. As such, there will likely be a lack
of consistency around the practice, making it harder to evaluate its
efficacy. Exception seeking, a fundamental aspect of solution-focused
approaches, was only explicitly mentioned by five interviewees. Due to
the lack of strict adherence to any model, it is uncertain whether the
interviewees therefore use this crucial solution-focused tool. The
efficacy of consultation is therefore threatened and consultee
confidence in the EP employing evidence-based practices is undermined.

This was the only code to be cited by every EP yet seems to run counter
to the often-presented argument "I am not the expert". This may
represent an epistemic conflict between EPs desire to not be placed in a
position of power for fear of undermining consultee engagement, but also
recognising the need to have expert knowledge to be able to lead an
effective consultation. One of the reasons it was believed to be
essential for effective consultation was because many believed it formed
the bedrock of how the EP leads a consultation. This knowledge also
helps provide a structure for the consultation, thus making it more
effective [@wagnerConsultationFrameworkPractice2008]. This is because a
structure can help keep the consultation focused on a single concern
which can be tackled [@newmanQualitativeMetasynthesisConsultation2017].

The ability to ask difficult questions and to know what questions to ask
to move a situation forward were frequently given as a key feature of
effective consultation. These questions, developed through training and
experience, help identify the presenting problem and limits to this, as
well as areas where they need more information
[@hylanderEstablishingPsychologicalConsultation2017]. By thoroughly
preparing for the consultation, for example having questions prepared in
advance, the efficacy of it can be increased. This is because it is
easier to know what questions to ask and to keep to the structure.
However, as some interviewees argued, keeping to the structure should
not come at the expense of listening to the concerns of the consultees
and being flexible to their needs. Without this, consultees risk feeling
devalued and thus disengaging
[@slonski-fowlerGeneralEducationTeachers2004]. This presents another
difficulty for EPs who wish to use consultation effectively. Whilst this
psychological knowledge is viewed as essential for effective
consultation, it can undermine this method by being too rigid.

Being a reflective practitioner is often cited in the literature as a
core component of being an EP, for example
@sanderSchoolBasedConsultationTraining2016, and many interviewees stated
the importance of this feature. This reflectivity included personal
reflection on one's own practice to aid professional development but
also the seeking of feedback from the consultees. By engaging in these
practices, interviewees believed one's consultations were more likely to
be effective and help the consultees and CYP move forward. This critical
analysis was not limited to after the consultation; being reflexive and
critically analysing what one was doing in the consultation and how it
was being received was believed to be an important feature of
consultation. This reflects many articles advocating for the importance
of reflexivity when working in education contexts
[@brunoEvaluatingReflexivePractices2011]. However, this in the moment
reflection was mentioned far fewer times than reflective and by almost a
third of the number of interviewees who talked about reflection.

##### 5.1.1.1.3 Intervention

One of the main mechanisms by which consultation could impact on the
consultees (and by extension CYP) is through changing the perspectives
of the consultees. This can be towards the situation, the child or young
person, or consultation itself. Engendering more positive views of the
child or young person has been cited as a key feature of consultation
[@masseImpactSchoolConsulting2013] and almost all interviewees
highlighted the importance of this active component of effective
consultation.

Providing emotional or therapeutic support to the consultees has been
identified as another key part of effective consultation
[@newmanQualitativeMetasynthesisConsultation2017]. When consultees are
highly distressed or anxious, they are unlikely to be able to engage in
consultation. Thus, emotionally containing them and bringing them to an
emotional space where they are able to engage with the process of
consultation is important.
@atkinsonEducationalPsychologistsTherapeutic2011 found that EPs often
use therapeutic interventions with consultation. However, as a few
interviewees identified, often this emotional containment requires time.
It is difficult to fully provide this support in a single consultation.
As such, one-off consultations with consultees may be less effective
because of the emotional needs of the consultees. To engage with the
consultation, they need therapeutic support. But often there is not time
to fully provide this. The EP must therefore decide to either
prematurely move the consultation to discussion of potential solutions
or forego said discussion in favour of emotionally supporting the
consultees. Making such a decision would be very difficult and could
undermine the efficacy of a consultation if made wrong.

##### 5.1.1.1.4 Context

Understanding the school is often cited in the literature as being an
important part of consultation, for example: "If consultants are not
internal to the organization, it is critical that they obtain insider
knowledge" [@knotekUtilizingCulturallyResponsive2012]. But very few
interviewees stated such knowledge was important for effective
consultation. This could reflect the interviewee's perception that
knowledge about the school system is not a feature of consultation but
is a prerequisite for consultation or an example of background
knowledge, rather than an explicit feature. However, it reveals another
disparity between how EPs view consultation and the academic literature.

Another disparity relates to the emphasis placed on the impact of the
individual personalities of the people who engage in consultation.
Almost all interviewees made some comment regarding the importance of
the types of people who take part and how this can impact the efficacy
of consultation. However, this is a rarely discussed aspect of
consultation in the literature. This may reflect the pragmatic stance
EPs take when reflecting on their own practice and how the personality
of their consultees or colleagues impacts a consultation. It may also
reflect the more theoretical or idealised standpoint that various
academic studies approach the issue from.

##### 5.1.1.1.5 Strengths-based

Empowering consultees was frequently cited by interviewees as being an
important feature of effective consultations. By supporting consultees
to develop their latent skills, they could be in a better position to
support CYP by increasing professional self-efficacy
[@knotekConsultationNewTeacher2002]. However, there was only one
recorded instance of empowering consultees in this manner. This suggests
that whilst EPs may state that it is an important feature, it is less
likely to feature in a consultation (even one that leads to change).
This may be because helping consultees to realise their ability to
already support CYP may be difficult to do in practice, especially if
the consultee is highly disempowered (such as during the teacher
consultation for child 2).

A small number of interviewees discussed the importance of highlighting
the strengths of CYP. This may be because this aspect of
Solution-focused approaches is assumed to be present when interviewees
talk about being Solution-focused in their consultations (18
interviewees mentioned this model explicitly). But without explicit
confirmation, it is unknown how many interviewees believe that this
specific part of Solution-focused approaches is important for
consultation. The discussing of CYP strengths was observed in every
consultation and had the second highest mean number of recorded
instances. This may be because it is a relatively easy feature to
include, given it can be as simple as a verbal acknowledgement of
something the child or young person is good at. This is in contrast with
other features within the Strengths-based theme, such as empowering
consultees.

##### 5.1.1.1.6 Shared understanding

Almost every interviewee talked about the importance of bringing in as
many different voices as possible. This included parents, the child, or
other adults who knows the child or young person well. This is because
"being able to identify the unique perspective of those with whom a
consultant is working are essential elements of building rapport and
relationships" [@sanderSchoolBasedConsultationTraining2016]. This is also a core feature of Wagner's model of consultation and shows that EPs explicitly adhere to parts of this model. Several EPs
also discussed the importance of bringing in the voices of those who
hold power within the system, such as headteachers. However, the sharing
of such voices was not observed in the consultations. The first
consultation was a joint home-school consultation and therefore the
views of the parent and teacher were included. But there was no direct
involvement of either the child (such as the parent or teacher asking
the child prior to the consultation what they wanted) or those with
power. This same pattern was observed for the other consultations which
were either just parent(s) or teacher consultations. There is the
potential therefore that whilst actively incorporating the voice of the
child and those with power in the system is endorsed by EPs, they often
do not clearly feature in consultations. This also raises questions as to how much EPs use Bronfenbrenner's ecosystemic model [@bronfenbrennerDevelopmentalEcologySpace1995] or adhere to the requirements of a core piece of legislation [@departmentforeducationSENDCodePractice2015]. This has ramifications for the efficacy of consultation as what is thought of as a key feature is ostensibly missing.

The establishing of the general plan for the consultation is frequently
given as a crucial first step in an effective consultation
[@meyersContractNegotiationStage2002]. This is to manage expectations
and establish a purpose for the consultation. This was a sentiment
shared by just over half the interviewees who cited purposes including
negotiating the purpose of the consultation and using questions to
establish what consultees hope to achieve. This feature was seen in
every consultation and there were fewer observations of it in
consultations which did not record change. This offers tentative
supportive for it being an important feature for having an effective
consultation, although other factors may have a stronger impact (such as
individual differences).

#### 5.1.1.2 What do EPs believe are the barriers to effective consultation?

The barriers to effective consultation were examined because through the
exploration of factors which undermine the efficacy of consultation, it
will reveal what is needed for an effective consultation to occur. Two
of the biggest barriers brought up by interviewees were not having the
key people involved or not having sufficient time. For a consultation to
be effective, the people who are in a position to change things need to
be involved. If they are not, they are unlikely to buy-in to the
proposed change and make sure it happens. The efficacy of the
consultation is also reduced if one is trying to elucidate a situation
and someone who knows the child or young person is not present.
Therefore, having the key people as part of the consultation is
essential for it to reach its full potential of providing clarity and
changing the situation (through perspective change and identifying
support strategies).

Time constraints was identified as one of the main barriers to effective
consultation. Therefore, an effective consultation needs time. The
minimum time limit for an effective consultation was judged to be 30
minutes, although most interviewees preferred to have 45 minutes to one
hour. This meant that the consultees did not feel rushed through the
process, which undermines the efficacy of consultation
[@websterMediationConsulteeConceptual2003]. Having time also ensures
that consultees could be properly supported emotionally before exploring
solutions. Time has also been found to be essential for consultee
empowerment and learning [@truscottProfessionalDevelopmentModel2004]. A
lack of time has also been found to decrease the consultee's sense of
ownership for the solutions [@babinskiSupportingNewTeachers1998], which
is one of the main mechanisms through which the features of consultation
are effective (see section 5.1.1.3).

A perennial barrier to effective consultation is a lack of resources
from the school. If the school does not have the resources to implement
any of the devised solutions, it is unlikely the situation will improve
for the child or young person. This lack of resources may also affect
the consultees as they feel disempowered even before they have entered
the consultation. They are therefore less likely to buy-in to the
process of actively seeking change and taking ownership of the
situation, because they feel like forces beyond their control are
stopping them.

Another barrier related to the schools is the general effect of wider
education systems, such as operating within the traded model or the EHCP
process. Almost all interviewees referred to the impact education
systems can have on effective consultation. The way a school operates
was cited as a significant potential barrier for effective consultation.
Because schools buy EP time, they may believe they have greater control
over the nature of the work they are commissioning as customers
[@leeExplorationDevelopingRole2017]. This arguably constitutes a form of
school knowledge, as an awareness of the school's values and how it
understands EP work impacts on the efficacy of consultation. If a school
does not value consultation, then they are less likely to provide
resources for interventions or cover teachers' lessons so they can
attend a consultation. These all undermine the efficacy of consultation.
This idea relates to the importance of trying to include those with
power in the consultation. If this can be done, or at least the
consultees know that those with power see consultation in and of itself
as worthwhile, then consultation is more likely to be effective as
interventions are more likely to be put in place.

Seven interviewees made comments about the amount of work they have to
do and how this negatively affects their consultations. The sheer volume
of work means they felt they did not have the mental space to be able to
fully engage in a given consultation because of stress and feelings of
being overworked. This workload also prohibited them from being able to
fully prepare for consultations, such as reading the case file prior to
the consultation. This was felt to be a significant barrier to the
efficacy of consultation. Previous research has identified the shift to
traded services as being a significant factor in the increase of EP
workload [@islamInvestigationEducationalPsychologists2013].

#### 5.1.1.3 What do EPs believe makes those features effective?

The most frequently discussed reason that the identified features help
ensure consultation is effective is that it is efficient. This took a
few forms, such as being efficient for seeing more children in a short
space of time (as opposed to direct work with children). Many of the
benefits reflect some of the pressures interviewees felt. Several EPs
discussed the need to use consultation because schools could not buy in
more time but wanted psychological input for many children. They may
have also perceived a need to demonstrate their value for money within a
traded context [@leeExplorationDevelopingRole2017] and so emphasised the
cost-efficient nature of consultation. However, consultation was also
efficient because of its ability to have an impact wider than the
consultation itself. Through empowering consultees, changing
perspectives, and emotionally supporting consultees, consultation can
have positive effects for consultees, CYP, and schools as a whole if
they change policy as a result of an effective consultation.

The key reason identified for making such features as Collaborative, EP
encouraging engagement, and Rapport effective was the fact it engendered
Consultee ownership of the situation. By making the consultation
Collaborative, by Empowering consultees, those involved feel better
equipped to support CYP and more motivated to implement recommendations
[@erchulSchoolConsultationConceptual2012].

Another reason identified for making features related to EP knowledge
and skills effective is the fact consultation presents a varied space
for approach. By allowing a wide range of practices and skills to be
used, consultation can be highly flexible to the needs of the consultees
and CYP and thus be best suited to facilitate change. However, the fact
consultation is a platform to allow various psychological tools and
models to be used can be detrimental to EPs and consultees. Given the
potential differences in practice, a consultee without prior experience
is very unlikely to know what to expect prior to a given consultation.
This undermines their ability to buy-in to the process and thus
threatens one of the key mechanisms of effective consultation.

A number of interviewees talked about the importance of being external
to the school system. This being outside the school system meant that
questions could be asked that otherwise could not be and an external
perspective could be brought in
[@cordingStudyEducationalPsychologists2011]. This is particularly
valuable for when a situation feels "stuck", and consultees feel
powerless. By being external, they may be able to see what is already
working and give new recommendations for supporting CYP.

The giving of recommendations links to another mechanism through which
these features of consultation are effective: that what is recommended
is Realistic. By listening to the consultees and valuing their opinions,
EPs are more likely to be able to make recommendations that fit within
the context of the school and can be reasonably put in. If an EP makes a
series of grand recommendations for the child or young person but the
school does not have the means to implement them, then there is little
chance the situation will improve. But by having a collaborative
consultation, in which recommendations are co-created, the solutions are
more likely to be feasible and therefore the chance of having an
effective consultation and a positive impact is increased. This is
associated with the final mechanism through which these features are
effective: treating the Consultees as experts. By taking on board the
views of the consultees and seeing them as having expertise to bring to
the discussion, the consultation is more likely to be effective
[@truscottCreatingConsulteeChange2012]. Consultees will be more likely
to buy-in to the process if they feel valued and listened to and the
recommendations are more likely to be relevant if those who know the
school and the child or young person most are actively involved. Whilst
there is theoretical evidence to suggest this an important feature, only
a small number of interviewees explicitly mentioned this as a valuable
mechanism for effective consultations. This reveals another instance of
the disparity between what the academic literature highlights as
important and what practicing EPs believe is important.

### 5.1.2 Which combination of features of consultation are seen with progress towards agreed goals?

#### 5.1.2.1 Non-formal analysis of features and goals

A majority of the goals were judged to have experienced progress,
bolstering the claim made in @dunsmuirEvidenceBasedPractice2009. Of
those which saw progress, patterns can be drawn. A qualitative
examination of the correspondence between features of consultation and
change revealed that consultations with fewer recorded instances of
Understanding the presenting problem were more likely to see change.
Such examples include the parent consultation for child 2 and the parent
consultation for child 4 (see Appendix L for all observed features and
change). There was also a greater number of instances of Suggesting
solutions by the EP during consultations which saw change, such as the
first consultation and the parent consultation for child 4.

There was a disparity between what interviewees stated was important and
what was observed in the consultations. Collaboration was given by
almost every interviewee as a crucial feature. However, observable
instances of this feature were less frequently seen than the EP
exploring the presenting problem for a majority of consultations. This
may represent a gap between what EPs say is important and what they do
in a consultation when they are there to support a specific child or
young person. It does, however, corroborate the importance of EPs using
parts of models e.g., problem-analysis framework. This is because for
each consultation the most frequently seen feature was Understanding the
presenting problem. This is substantiated by the fact one of the EPs who
was observed stated in their interview that the main model they use in
their practice is the problem-analysis framework. On the other hand,
this emphasis on exploring the depth and limits of the main problem may
not reflect adherence to this model (and thus be evidence for the
importance of using said model). It may just be an exploration of the
main difficulties (and arguably the reason why the consultation was
organised). The absence of other features of the Problem-analysis
framework, such as discussing how to implement an intervention, is
suggestive of the perceived need by EPs to fully understand the
presenting problem rather than fully commit to a certain model. This
suggests a disparity between how EPs say they work and what happens in a
consultation.

The importance of the individual differences of the consultees was
highlighted in these observations, as consultees who were more
optimistic and less stressed were better able to engage collaboratively
and not focus as much on exploring the negative aspects of the
situation. Examples of these include the parent consultation for child 2
as the ratio between Understanding presenting problem and other features
was more even. The teacher consultation for child 2 was also an
opportunity to highlight the importance of emotionally supporting
consultees, given how upset the consultee was and therefore unable to
engage with one aspect of the consultation prior to said support.

The fact three putatively core features of effective consultation
(School knowledge, EP explaining role, and Planning/implementing
interventions) were not recorded once undermines the argument that they
are important for effective consultations. This is also true for
Empowering individuals as this was only recorded once. They do not
appear to be necessary and perhaps are not sufficient for change to be
judged as having occurred. Even though there were instances of the EP
offering solutions in most consultation, there was no discussion of the
specifics of how any suggestion was to be implemented (as there were no
recorded instances of Planning/implementing interventions). There was
also no review of any prior interventions. This raises questions as to
how effective the suggestions are. If they are left to the consultees to
establish and decide how often an intervention should be run for, will
it be as effective as if it were decided with the person who is believed
to have expert knowledge?

There was a lack of consistency regarding the discrepancy between the
ratings given by parents and teachers: one consultation saw the teacher
identifying change and the parent not, another saw the parent judging
there to have been progress but the teacher not. This reflects the fact
TME is based upon the perceptions of change by consultees and thus there
may be different conceptions and criteria for judging change between
consultees [@connorTargetMonitoringEvaluation2010]. However, the sample
is too small to draw any patterns or conclusions from this data.

Change may not have been observed in some consultations because the
goals were not specific enough or were poor quality, such as not being
sufficiently related to the key area of need. If the goals were not
sufficiently defined or relevant to the child's needs, then change was
unlikely to have been judged to occur. This is most clearly seen for one
of the goals for Child 1, as the parent did not understand what the goal
referred to and thus couldn't rate progress. This reveals a potentially
large problem with TME and arguably consultation: consultees agreeing
with goals or recommendations but not knowing what they are. This
greatly undermines the efficacy of consultation, because if a key person
expected to help the child or young person make progress does not
understand what has been agreed to, they cannot support them to make
positive changes.

#### 5.1.2.2 QCA

QCA identified three combination of features which were sufficient for
change after calibration and Boolean minimisation. The validity of QCA
for this data set is undermined as three goals which saw change
contained no features after calibration (goals for the parent
consultation of child 2). Therefore, limited conclusions can be drawn
from this analysis. The combinations which contain a mixture of present
and absent features are subsequently explored. One such combination of
conditions which led to change was: Setting out consultation plan,
Understanding the presenting problem, Discussing what's already working,
and Gathering information. The other combination was: Ideas for future
EP work, Setting out consultation plan, EP using expert knowledge,
Summarising, and Suggesting solutions. Only one feature is shared
between these combinations (Setting out consultation plan). This gives
tentative support for the importance of establishing the consultation
plan as this feature was also observed during the other consultation
which saw change and had recorded features post calibration. This
feature is the first step in Monsen's streamlined version of the
problem-analysis framework [@woolfsonIntegratedFrameworkGuide2003] and
provides support for the utility of this model.

There was also overlap between the two consultations as to the features
that were absent. For both consultations with a mixture of present and
absent features, the lack of empowering individuals, valuing
contributions from those involved, and discussing CYP strengths did not
prohibit change from being observed. This raises questions about the
efficacy of certain popular models, such as Solution-focused. This is
because a core idea of this approach for EP consultation is that to be
effective, EPs need to empower the consultees, value their
contributions, and highlight the capabilities of the child or young
person. This was a common sentiment among the interviewees and reveals
a disparity between what EPs say are core features of consultation and
what was sufficient for positive change.

## 5.2 Limitations

### 5.2.1 Interviews

Despite the large amount of interview data, there are limitations with
the methods chosen and the data analysis. No measures were taken to
ensure the reliability of the TA, such as using inter-rater reliability.
It is therefore unknown to what extent the biases of the sole analyst of
the transcripts biased the analysis. There are also limitations of the
methodology employed (TA) as this provides only a surface level analysis
of codes and themes. As such, the depth of the data was not plumbed, and
latent themes were not examined.

For the features that were identified, many were broad, ill-defined
concepts such as 'collaborative' rather than features which could be
observed. This means that there were many features which were
inductively coded which could not have been used as deductive codes or
form part of the observation schedule. There is therefore the potential
that the observation schedule missed some core features due to the fact
many "features" of consultation are not operationalised.

There were also limitations of the tools used to conduct the interviews.
Although Zoom underwent security improvements, there was still a risk of
interference or data loss which are not present in face-to-face
interviews. To mitigate this risk, the in-built recording function was
not used. There were also connectivity issues present in a few
consultations. Typically, only a few words were lost, but it is unknown
how much of an impact this may have had on the contents of the
interviews. There were also three interviews which interrupted by family
members. Whilst this did not directly lead to a loss of data, it
interrupted the flow of the interview and may have impacted on what the
interviewee said. It is unknown how great an impact these factors had on
the TA, although the risk of codes or themes being lost due to them is
minimised because of the amount of data collected.

Another limitation related to the use of video technology, and one which
speaks to the heart of tech consultations, relates to the level of
engagement of consultees. Whilst tech consultations can increase
accessibility for consultees, they can also result in consultees
participating in other activities during the consultation. This reduces
their ability to focus and thus potentially understand certain parts of
the consultation. For example, during the establishing goals phase at
the end of the joint home-school consultation for child 1, the parent
was driving and thus could not engage as fully. This likely led to the
parent being unable to give a rating for the second goal as they did not
understand it. Therefore, tech consultations may undermine the efficacy
of consultations because consultees may not have the mental space to
fully give to the consultation, thus undermining engagement. This
reduces the ability of the results to generalise to face-to-face
consultation, as such distractions are less likely when everyone is in
the same room together.

### 5.2.2 Observations

#### 5.2.2.1 Methodological

There were a number of potential methodological limitations of the
chosen methods for the quantitative arm of the research. One such
concern related to the nature of the features. By limiting the features
to what was explicitly said, features such as body language and more
abstract features were necessarily excluded from the analysis.
Therefore, potentially valuable features may have been missed. A related
issue concerned the nature of recording the presence of features. As
there was only one observer, there is a risk of subjective
interpretation of features. The ICC of the observation checklist was
under 0.5 and therefore, by the standards given by
@kooGuidelineSelectingReporting2016, is 'poor'. Thus, there is the
potential for unreliability in the recording of the features.

One component of solution-focused approaches (exploring exceptions) was
not included in the observation schedule due to a clerical error. Thus,
instances of an observed feature which was mentioned by interviewees was
missed. This undermines the validity of the observation results. Another
issue relating to the features included in the observation schedule
related to their potential thoroughness. The large disparity between the
theoretically derived codes and the inductive codes suggests the current
literature does not capture the breadth of features present in
consultation. Whilst the features of consultation were supported in
previous work, it was a small-scale project limited to a small number of
EPs. Therefore, the observation schedule may be missing key features of
an effective consultation. This undermines the validity of the
quantitative results.

Another potential limitation related to the use of TME. This tool has
not been demonstrated as being a suitable measure of the effectiveness
of consultation. There is evidence to suggest it can be used to measure
change for a child on a given goal, for example
[@connorTargetMonitoringEvaluation2010]. However, as this same thesis
identified, it is very difficult to attribute the observed change to the
consultation itself due to the many other factors which may influence
the rating of change. Without rigorous identification of interventions
or means to support CYP and follow-up to confirm these happen, we cannot
know how much of an impact the consultation had on the consultees and
the consequent impact on the CYP.

There was another practical issue with the use of TME for this research.
The majority of consultations (four of the six) took place prior to the
Christmas holidays. This break was then followed by a second national
lockdown. The children therefore spent a majority of the 6-8-week period
out of school, where most of their support was expected to be delivered.
This may have resulted in the children making less progress than
predicted, given the extended time they were out of school.

#### 5.2.2.2 Sample

The initial conception of the research limited observations to joint
home-school consultations. However, due to the difficulty in arranging
such observations, the scope was broadened to any consultation. Since
the interviews occurred prior to the observations, when the research
questions focused solely on joint home-school consultations,
interviewees may have put the focus of their answers on joint
home-school consultations. One interviewee made such a comment. It is
therefore unknown whether the answers from the interviewees would be
different if the scope of the questions had been broader from the
beginning. However, most interviewees seemed to approach the questions
with consultations in general in mind. Thus, one can be reasonably
confident the qualitative data results are like what would have
otherwise been seen. The number of interviews (30) also helped reduce
the impact this narrower a focus some interviewees had towards the
questions.

Issues with the generalisability of the findings were raised due to the
fact the observations were almost exclusively from one EP. Both EPs
observed worked in the same LA and all the observed consultations were
remote. We therefore cannot be certain that the findings extend to other
EPs in other LAs and to in-person consultations. The issue of
generalisability is also raised by the fact one of the consultations
(the parent consultation for child 4), the main body was dictated by the
use of the Cognitive abilities profile. This highly structured tool
therefore involved many questions exploring the presenting problem and
other areas. As such, it may not be representative of a consultation
which does not use that tool or is less structured.

#### 5.2.2.3 QCA

QCA is a valuable tool for examining causal patterns in conditions for
complex phenomena. However, it does not allow the valuation of the
relative impact of different features for change. This is a problem as
it is therefore difficult to know how important features are for change.
For example, individual differences as a feature (specifically the
stress levels of the consultees) appears to have a large impact on
change, whereas setting out the consultation plan appears to have a much
smaller impact. This qualitative analysis cannot be corroborated by QCA
and therefore potentially important conclusions may be lost.

There are also concerns as to the appropriateness of QCA for this data
set. @marxCrispSetQualitativeComparative2011 recommends eschewing QCA
when there are more conditions than cases. This is because of the
increased risk of each case forming a unique configuration, which
invalidates the ability of QCA to find common combinations. There is
also an increased chance of the data being random but still finding an
explanatory model [@marxCrispsetQualitativeComparative2010]. This
appears to be the case for the present data set. There were 10 cases
(six of which had unique features) and 14 conditions. There was
therefore an increased risk of being unable to find meaningful
combinations of conditions to glean patterns. The results showed that
each combination only corresponded to one consultation with very little
overlap between combinations. This made drawing conclusions regarding
the consistent combination of features to change very difficult.

Another issue related to the calibration thresholds. Using the mean as
the threshold resulted in the consultation which saw the most change
(parent consultation for child 2) recording no features present. This
undermines the ability to draw conclusions regarding combinations of
conditions. A more appropriate threshold would be one weighted by the
total number of observations per case. This would overcome the problem
of some cases containing a higher number of features and thus consigning
other cases to record no features after calibration.

## 5.3 Future directions

Whilst this research contributes to our collective understanding of
consultation, there are future directions in which this research can be
taken to broaden its impact. Exploring the views of consultees with
regards to the effective features of consultations would be highly
valuable. This is because those who are involved but do not have the
theoretical training can provide opinions not filtered through the
biases of their training or desire for it to be seen as an effective way
of working. They will also have greater first-hand experience of what
the consequences of a consultation are and whether it was effective or
not.

Despite the limitations put forward in section 5.2.2, the use of an
observation schedule and QCA to explore combinations of causal
conditions is valid. To increase the chance of meaningful conclusions
being drawn, a greater number of consultations should be observed. There
would thus be a more conducive case to condition ratio, for example at
least 30 cases to the 14 conditions. TME could be used again as the
measure of change, although this could be done in tandem with other more
robust measures, as was done in @connorTargetMonitoringEvaluation2010.

Alternatively, another measure of consultation efficacy could be
developed. This measure would focus on a mechanism by which consultation
can have a direct impact on the consultees. For example, by changing the
perspectives of the consultees. This could be in relation to feeling
better able to support the child or young person or more hopeful for the
future. A multi-item questionnaire exploring the construct(s) would be
presented to the consultees before and after the consultation. This same
questionnaire could be presented a few months later to see how long-term
the change in perspectives for the consultee(s) is (if at all). How
perspective change then impacts CYP could be explored through interviews
or questionnaires, as potentially increased support may be given, or the
consultees may have a more positive outlook for the CYP.

The present data presents opportunities for further work. Given the
surface level analysis of the interview transcripts, there is large
amount of data not yet examined. The use of Grounded theory
[@straussGroundedTheoryMethodology1994] or Interpretative
Phenomenological Analysis
[@smithInterpretativePhenomenologicalAnalysis2003] may allow a more
detailed exploration of the latent themes within the data.

## 5.4 Researcher reflections

This section will explore my reflections on the research process and
what I have learned from conducting this piece of research. Prior to
developing this work, I did not value qualitative research
methodologies. I did not understand them and consequently did not
believe they could be used to explore complex phenomena in a meaningful.
Learning about TA and utilising it in this research has thoroughly
dissuaded me of that notion. I now clearly understand why qualitative
research methods are used and their value. I will be integrating them
into my future research as I believe mixed methods research is the most
robust and comprehensive means of examining something like consultation.

Whilst the process of TA was laborious, the results were worth the time
spent. I take satisfaction in the ease with which the themes revealed
themselves after the rounds of coding the transcripts. This suggests
that the methodology was robust and allowed for the detailing of what I
sought to examine (the effective features of consultation). I am also
grateful I sent out several calls for participants. The large number of
interviews presented the opportunity to create very rich data about the
views regarding effective consultations from a wide range of EPs.

This work has been greatly affected by the global pandemic. However,
these difficulties presented the possibility to expand the scope of this
work and it has been improved for it. I have also been presented with an
opportunity to explore consultation as it will likely be performed in
the future: as technologically mediated consultations. Whilst tech
consultations are unlikely to replace face-to-face consultations
entirely, they will undoubtedly form an integral part of the EP working
landscape in the future. Thus, to have explored their use and what makes
them effective is highly valuable and can help EPs ensure their
consultations are effective.

The development and conducting of this research has been the most
rewarding piece of work I have ever done. To deeply delve into the
theoretical background of consultation and then explore it through
qualitative and quantitative methods has given me valuable insight into
this tool. I am very grateful for the opportunity to have done this
work. Engaging in this exploration of consultation has solidified my
desire to employ this as my primary model of working. I have been fully
persuaded of its utility through the discussion with EPs and gaining a
deeper understanding of what it is and what it can achieve. This has
strengthened my resolve to continue researching it and make it as
effective as possible. Not just for the children and young people it is
used in service of, or the consultees who engage in it, but other EPs
who use this methodology. We are in a privileged position to help those
in very difficult situations. It is therefore imperative that the
methods we use are evidence-based and have rigorously shown to be
beneficial for those involved.

## 5.5 Conclusions and recommendations

This piece of work represents an attempt to systematically identify the
features of consultation which lead to change for CYP. By employing a
mixed methods approach, the beliefs of practicing EPs regarding the
effective features of consultation were detailed, along with recorded
instances of various features of consultation. These recordings were
tabulated against measures of change for co-operatively agreed goals by
the EP and consultees. The relative presence or absence of said features
were then analysed to see if patterns of features could be identified.
Whilst statistical analyses did not yield conclusive results, the
breadth of qualitative data combined with the non-formal analysis of
features and ratings of change present a picture of what is necessary
for an effective consultation. Given this, the goal of this research is
to provide guidance to EPs such that they are more confident in their
ability lead an effective consultation and help create positive change
for the CYP they work with. This is through ensuring they include in
their consultations the features identified as being effective for
eliciting change.

To lead an effective consultation, EPs need to have specialist knowledge
to thoroughly explore an area of need for a child or young person. By
creating a collaborative space in which consultees feel valued, through
the development of rapport and encouraging the participation of
consultees, EPs can hope to change the perspectives of those involved
and identify potential solutions. By exploring the views of consultees
and using various questions, a shared understanding of the child or
young person and situation can be created. Through consultation, EPs can
impact not only those involved in the consultation, by providing
therapeutic support, but those outside the consultation through the
ripple effects consultation can have on people and systems. By being
collaborative, consultees can not only feel empowered to support CYP but
to take ownership of the situation and actively work to improve the
situation for all. To facilitate EPs in their pursuit of effective
consultations, a checklist of effective features has been created
(Appendix M). This will serve as a guide for EPs and TEPs in how to lead
an effective consultation.

Given this research, an effective consultation can be defined as: 'a
meeting (at least 30 minutes in a confidential space) of an EP and at
least one knowledgeable person of the child or young person (preferably
more) wherein the EP uses their expert knowledge to facilitate
engagement of the consultees, through developing a rapport, to bring the
consultees' expert knowledge to collaboratively gain a clearer
understanding of the presenting problem and the context through
questioning and exploring the views of CYP. It has a clear purpose and
structure established at the beginning of or prior to the meeting which
aims to create a path forward, through the EP empowering the consultees
to realise their own and the child's strengths in which everyone comes
away with a path forward and actively agrees to these next steps. After
the consultation, the EP should reflect on the process and seek to gain
feedback to improve future consultations and check progress on the
agreed recommendations and goals.'

Consultation is fundamental to the work of EPs in the UK. However, there
remain significant questions as to what constitutes consultation and how
it can be effective in supporting CYP. This presents challenges to TEPs
and EPs alike, resulting in many claiming to practice consultation when
in fact they do not. It is therefore of vital importance for us as a
profession to clarify what we mean by consultation and how we can engage
in it effectively. My hope is that this work can go some way in shining
a light on the core features of an effective consultation and thus
empower EPs to lead consultations which improve the lives of those we
seek to help.
