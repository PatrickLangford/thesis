# Abstract

Consultation is an integral part of many Educational Psychologist's
(EPs) work. Yet there is a large heterogeneity in understanding and use
of this tool. Such diversity makes evaluating its efficacy difficult.
This research therefore sought to identify what the effective features
of consultation are by linking features to changes in agreed outcomes
for children and young people (CYP). A mixed methodology was employed to
explore what EPs believe are the key features of consultation, what
happens in a consultation about a CYP, and which features can be
identified in consultations which lead to positive changes for CYP. 30
EPs were interviewed exploring their views on the effective features of
consultation and how they have altered their practice due to the
lockdown. 6 consultations were observed, with features identified, and
the changes in outcomes for CYP were measured using Target Monitoring
Evaluation forms. These forms were completed at the end of the
consultation and 6-8 weeks later, to allow analysis of which features
were present for children with differing progress towards outcomes. The
most effective features of consultation, as identified by EPs, included
the collaborative nature of consultation, the use of questioning to
fully understand the issue, and working with the consultees to generate
solutions to help the CYP.

# Impact statement

Consultation is a fundamental but understudied pillar of educational
psychology (EP) practice in the U.K. This research sought to
qualitatively and systematically identify the core features of a
consultation which helps produce change for the children and young
people (CYP) we work with. By taking a mixed methods approach, this
complex question could be analysed in a multitude of ways and through a
range of methodologies. By doing so, the scope and depth of the issue is
more likely to be understood. This can have a positive impact on both
future research and practicing EPs across the country by helping them
identify what they need to include in a consultation for it to be
effective.

The data from this piece of research will be made publicly available,
such that other researchers can download and analyse the results. Whilst
thematic analysis was used, there are a wealth of methodologies which
could be used to analyse the interview transcripts. There is also a
range of research questions which can be explored using this data, thus
allowing the research to have greater academic impact beyond this
thesis.

As this is the first example of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA)
within educational psychology research, this thesis serves as an
introduction to this methodology. It will hopefully encourage other
researchers to use this tool in the exploration of the causal
relationship between combinations of causes and outcomes. QCA is a
valuable tool to not only explore the relationship between features of
consultation and change for CYP, but any desire to identify causal
patterns for complex phenomena.

This research will form part of the picture guiding EPs use of
consultation in the future, such that better outcomes for CYP can be
achieved through engaging in evidence-based practice. The findings of
this thesis will be shared via open access platforms, allowing the
widest readership and thus the greatest impact. By providing EPs with
evidence-based recommendations, their practice will improve and the
positive they will have in the communities they work will be increased.

This work can also be used to help Trainee Educational Psychologists
(TEPs) gain an understanding of what consultation is and how they can be
effective practitioners. Learning how to use consultation effectively is
a foundational aspect of being an EP
[@hatzichristouMultilevelApproachSystemLevel2017]. This research can
help elucidate the core features of consultation and what leads to
change for CYP. It can therefore help ensure TEPs employ evidence-based
practices in their work and support their development of proficiency in
effective consultation, which is essential for all training
[@newellAssessingStateEvidence2014].

# 1 Introduction

This research consisted of interviews with Educational Psychologists
(EPs), the development of a novel questionnaire, and observations of
consultations with long-term follow-up. This was in service of exploring
what the core features of consultation are according to EP self-report
and observation of real-world consultations. The interviews explored EPs
definition of consultation, their views on what the key features of
effective consultations are, what some of the barriers are. The
observation schedule was informed by the relevant literature and was
used to see how often different features of consultation were observed
during a consultation and in what order. This was then to be
cross-referenced with reported progress towards jointly agreed goals for
the child to see which features correlate with improved outcomes. This
work built on a previous piece of research exploring what EPs believed
were the most important features of consultation and a thematic analysis
(TA) of recorded initial consultations to identify the main features in
a live consultation.

## 1.1 Literature Review

A literature review was conducted to see what previous research had
found to be the main features of consultation and what the main tools of
analysing the efficacy of consultation were. Various databases,
including Web of Science and Scopus, were searched using the key words
"educational psychology" and "consultation". Key references, such as
@kennedyEducationalPsychologistsWalk2008a, were given to the researcher
by their supervisor to set a baseline for the literature review.
Considering all the relevant literature, there is some consistency
around EPs views regarding consultation. However, there is a
heterogeneity of understanding from other stakeholders as to what
consultation actually means. Crucially, there is a relatively small
amount of research exploring what happens during a consultation
[@kennedyEducationalPsychologistsWalk2008a], as well as few studies
evaluating the efficacy of consultation. There are also few studies
which attempt to analyse what makes consultation effective or what the
effective features of consultation are. This leaves EPs and associated
stakeholders with a widely used but poorly understood and validated
framework.

### 1.1.1 What is consultation?

Consultation takes many different forms across contexts and countries.
Consequently, there is not a universal definition of consultation as
conducted by EPs. This raises an important problem for any EP who wishes
to engage in consultation or analyse its efficacy. Within a western
context, it fundamentally involves problem solving between consultants
(EPs) and consultees. The consultee is most often a teacher who knows
the CYP well, but it can also be parents and/or Special Educational
Needs Coordinator (SENCOs). In joint school-family consultations, it is
generally agreed prior to the consultation that at least one member from
the child's family unit and the school will attend. These individuals
collaborate to devise and establish interventions to help support and
find solutions for the client, the CYP
[@ofarrellResearchExploringParents2018]. Consultation is considered a
form of 'indirect' work as the theory is that the EP can enact the most
change for the CYP by meeting and working with those around the CYP
[@gutkinReconceptualizingSchoolPsychology1990]. They may or may not
engage one to one with the CYP but it is not mandated by this approach.

Consultation has become the model of service delivery for many
Educational Psychology Services [@sheridanRandomizedTrialExamining2017].
Most Educational Psychology Services (EPS) in the U.K. have moved
towards a predominantly consultation-based service
[@ofarrellResearchExploringParents2018]. This is in contrast with what
is viewed as a more traditional model which predominantly involves
individual casework, typically including the administration of a
cognitive assessment [@kratochwillEvidenceBasedInterventionsSchool2002;
@larneySchoolBasedConsultationUnited2003]. The most commonly employed
consultation framework in the U.K. is the Wagner model
[@wagnerConsultationApproachEducational1995;
@wagnerSchoolConsultationFrameworks1995;
@wagnerConsultationDevelopingComprehensive2000]. It is defined as "a
voluntary, collaborative, non-supervisory approach, established to aid
the functioning of a system and as inter-related systems"
[@wagnerConsultationDevelopingComprehensive2000] through "purposeful
[conversations] which [use] techniques of listening, clarifying,
problem-solving, challenging, questioning and reflecting"
[@munroAnglesDevelopingConsultation2000]. As a result, EPs work with
those closest to the CYP, but not as experts telling those directly
involved with the CYP how to help them. Their role is to help empower
the consultees to solve their own problems in school. The focus is not
only on the CYP but their relations with others and the many different
environments they are in, such as home, school, and their wider
community, ideas from @bronfenbrennerEcologyHumanDevelopment1981. There
is an understanding of the interactions between these layers and the
need to consider a child holistically. This support is provided by
asking questions, analysing presenting problems and helping others think
differently, agreeing on potential interventions, and then reflecting on
the whole process so progress can be made.

### 1.1.2 How prevalent is consultation in the U.K.?

The move towards a consultation-based model of service is reflected in
government legislation. The Special Education Needs: Code of Practice
characterises consultation as one of the main services of EPs
[@departmentforeducationSENDCodePractice2015]. Several studies have also
found it makes up a large percentage of their time working with schools.
@shannonEducationalPsychologistEarly2007 delivered questionnaires to 44
EPs, asking for the EPs to self-report how often they undertook
different types of work, including consultation or case work. 32
responded, with most reporting they spent a majority of their time
engaging in individual level work. 91% of the EPs who were doing
individual level work stated consultation was the main activity
performed. However, the authors do not provide a definition of
consultation nor ask the EPs to provide a definition of consultation.
Given that consultation takes many different forms and there are a wide
range of views on consultation between EPs and other stakeholders,
ensuring everyone has the same definition of the process is crucial.
Without it, one cannot be sure different EPs are engaging in
consultation in a similar way and that the schools understand what they
are doing. Participants may have reported they used consultation, but in
practice their methods may be very different. Because of the limits of
self report, we do not know if such a disparity exists in this study. On
the other hand, the EPs who responded were from a large range of
locations across the U.K., thus increasing the representativeness of the
data.

Another study exploring the prevalence of consultation in the UK comes
from @leadbetterPatternsServiceDelivery2000 The authors sent
questionnaires to all Principal Educational Psychologists (PEPs) and
asked about their models of service delivery. Consultation was reported
as one of the most frequently used models. However, there was only a
return rate of 58%, with those not returning almost certainly not
randomly distributed. There is therefore uncertainty around the amount
of bias in the results. If the non-returns were randomly distributed on
key variables, such as whether the EPs has recently experienced a number
of organisational changes, then a low return rate would not introduce
bias into the results. But this is unlikely. As such, the results of
certain PEPs who may have different results from the norm are missing.

Although consultation forms the bedrock of many EPs work and the model
of service delivery for EPS, EPs often struggle to articulate what a
consultation model of service entails.
@leadbetterRoleMediatingArtefacts2004 argues there is little research
which explicates the structure and process of consultation. This
situation has not improved over the following years, with the few
studies examining this typically only focusing on one EPS or a small
number of EPs [@cordingStudyEducationalPsychologists2011;
@leadbetterInvestigatingConceptualisingNotion2006;
@pipherConsultationApproachTeacher2013a]. These limitations prohibit one
from developing a broad picture of how consultation is performed in the
U.K.

### 1.1.3 What are consultees views on consultation?

Before exploring what occurs in a consultation, understanding what those
involved (EPs, teachers) believe it to be is important. This is because
if consultees are to play an active role in consultations (as all models
of consultation state they should), their views of consultation need to
be understood. That way, any misunderstandings can be cleared up and
consultation can be effective. To serve this end, the following section
explore stakeholders' views of consultation as detailed in the relevant
scientific literature. @ofarrellResearchExploringParents2018 interviewed
three groups containing a teacher, an EP, and the parents of the child
the consultation was about. The teachers and parents reported that wile
they appreciated and saw the value of consultation, there was a lack of
understanding regarding its process and nature. All three teachers
implied they viewed the EP as the external expert, who had specialist
knowledge and access to resources which they wanted. This is in direct
contrast to the sentiments expressed by the EPs in this study. They
explicitly stated they were not experts and tried to distance themselves
from that sentiment. This concept is fundamental to many models of
consultation, including Wagner's. This research was conducted in the
Republic of Ireland. Here, consultation has only become the dominant
model of service delivery in recent years. Thus, U.K. based teachers and
SENCOs may have a better understanding. However, few pieces of research
have been conducted to explore understanding of this important strand of
EP work.

@dennisFarGoodQualitative2004 interviewed SENCOs at twelve schools to
better understand their views on EP work. One of the core themes raised
by the participants was a wish for EPS to "publicise more the range of
things it has to offer and good/innovative practice". The exact number
of schools which held this belief is unknown as that information was not
reported in the paper. Regarding consultation, there was a large
heterogeneity in the the school's understanding of it. Some schools were
fully aware of the consultation model of service delivery and preferred
it to previous models. Such models focused on direct work, including
assessment of CYP using cognitive assessments. However, other schools,
either did not understand the consultation model or were only partially
aware of it but preferred other models which placed a primacy on
child-focused individual work. They reported they believed the
consultation model involved "too much talk, not enough action"
[@dennisFarGoodQualitative2004, 22] and thus did not value it as highly.

This lack of understanding of consultation is found in other countries
as well. Many Australian EPS have also shifted their focus from an
assessment-based to a consultation-based model of service delivery. But
they also experience a lack of cohesion in understanding among
stakeholders regarding the meaning and process of consultation
[@bellPerceptionsRealitiesRole2013]. However, some EPs do not report
this problem. In the U.S.A., those who work with school psychologists
(as EPs are called) show a greater consistency of understanding of
consultation in schools. There is also a larger evidence base for the
efficacy of their form of consultation. This is because consultation as
practised in the U.S.A. is almost exclusively Conjoint Behavioural
Consultation (CBC). CBC is defined as "a strength-based, cross-system
problem-solving and decision-making model wherein parents, teachers, and
other caregivers or service providers work as partners and share
responsibility for promoting positive and consistent outcomes related to
a child's academic, behavioural, and social--emotional development"
[@sheridanConjointBehavioralConsultation2007, p.25]. CBC has been shown
to be effective for CYP over a wide range of settings and for many
presenting problems [@sheridanRandomizedTrialExamining2017]. This
hegemony of practice allows for a consistent definition and
implementation, and is likely one of the reasons consultation in the
U.S.A. is better understood and valued by stakeholders
[@reddyClinicalFocusConsultation2000]. It also means its efficacy can be
assessed more readily, such as by conducting a randomised control trial
conducted by @sheridanRandomizedTrialExamining2012

However, the lack of understanding by key stakeholders (SENCOs,
teachers, and parents) may not truly reflect the modern day conception
of consultation in the U.K. The research reporting these findings are
roughly 15 years old. It is reasonable to presume stakeholders have
become more familiar with it, given how prevalent it is. A more recent
paper exploring this is @cordingStudyEducationalPsychologists2011. For
this work, the authors interviewed 10 school personnel (such as Head
teachers and teachers) and 9 EPs in a Welsh Local Authority (LA). The
aim was to elicit their understanding of the kinds of work they believed
EPs engage in. There was a general alignment between the views of the
school personnel and the EPs themselves. But the school personnel stated
they greatly valued the EPs expertise in diagnosing and alleviating
presenting problems. This shows that despite there being a shared
understanding of what EPs do, there is still a divide in what
stakeholders value about EP work.

### 1.1.4 What are consultant's views on consultation?

The vast majority of EPs have a positive view of consultation, with the
Local Offer literature from many EPS stating their model of service
delivery is consultation, such as Kensington & Chelsea
[@royalboroughofkensingtonchelseaEducationalPsychologyService2019]. Some
EPs believe they provide a unique method of working through their use of
consultation [@ashtonWhatValuableUnique2006].
@ashtonWhatValuableUnique2006 sent questionnaires to both schools and
EPs asking for them to comment on the work EPs engage in. 22
questionnaires (out of 58) were returned from mainstream primary schools
and eight (out of nine) EPs completed the questionnaire. 'Statutory
assessment work', 'Closed tests' and 'Expert role' were the most
frequently provided parts of EP work that were classed as unique by
SENCOs. Few or no other agencies were judged by SENCOs as providing a
similar or the same service as EPs. 'Individual assessment and
intervention' and 'Consultation' were the aspects of EP work the EPs
themselves believed were unique to them, as no other service provided
these. This shows a clear disparity between the views of EPs and key
stakeholders within consultation (SENCOs). They also reported that
SENCOs typically valued more traditional EP work, such as individual
assessment and giving advice. The SENCOs did not value consultation, nor
give evidence they had a complete understanding of it. However, these
results should be interpreted with caution. The small sample limited to
one LA undermines our ability to generalise the results to a wider
context. It also only collected data from mainstream primary schools,
further limiting the scope of these results. Yet one of the main
results, namely the lack of understanding regarding the nature of
consultation) has been replicated by research in other school settings
[@dennisFarGoodQualitative2004; @ofarrellResearchExploringParents2018].

### 1.1.5 What are the main features of consultation?

Once a common understanding of what the stakeholders believe
consultation to be has been created, an analysis of the common features
of consultation can occur. The following section will evaluate the
relevant literature regarding the features of consultation.
@hendersonExplorationImpactConsultation2013 used focus groups with
clusters of SENCOs across a small LA to gain an understanding of their
beliefs about the mechanics of consultation. The researchers sat in on
five different Primary SENCO Network meetings and worked to elucidate
their views. They presented the participants with statements about parts
of the consultation process. Their task was to sort them depending on
how often they believed the statements to be a part of a consultation.
The mostly commonly given features of consultation were: discussing
issues with relevant parties; information gathering; and it being a
reflexive process with a focus on collaboratively crafting solutions.
They also conducted semi-structured interviews with EPs, children who
were receiving EP involvement, and their parents. It being a
collaborative and problem-solving process, with a focus on solutions,
and the development of positive working relationships between those
involved were the two main themes. The use of focus groups to identify
SENCO beliefs regarding the nature of consultation and the interviews
with the stakeholders allows comparison between the stakeholders
expectations and the reality of consultation. However, given the
researchers did not directly observe consultations but relied on
self-report, the conclusions that can be drawn regarding how
consultations occur are weakened. This is because of the disparity
between self-reports of behaviour and real-world instances of behaviour
[@argyrisTheoryPracticeIncreasing1992].

@kennedyEducationalPsychologistsWalk2008a thematically analysed the
voice recordings of 17 EP-teacher consultations. These individual case
studies [@robsonRealWorldResearch2015] were supplemented by a
pre-consultation questionnaire completed by EPs to establish their
espoused theory for consultation. A comparison could then be made
between the recordings and participants' self-report to see whether
their espoused theory aligned with the recorded behaviours. The authors
report a high correspondence between the EPs espoused theory and theory
in practice as EPs predominantly engaged in behaviours dictated by their
espoused theory. The most common behaviours by EPs were working
collaboratively, typically with those most involved (predominantly
parents) using either Solution-Focused approaches or problem-solving
analysis. Solution-Focused approaches are characterised by greater
interest in the solutions to presenting problems rather than the problem
itself. It views the client as capable of solving their own problems
with a changed mindset, facilitated by the EP, through identifying times
when the severity of the problem is reduced or it is not present, termed
'exceptions' [@rhodesSolutionFocusedThinking2004a]. Problem-solving
analysis is related to behavioural consultation
[@berganBehavioralConsultationTherapy1990] and is divided into four
stages: problem identification, problem analysis, treatment
implementation, and treatment evaluation
[@sheridanSchoolConsultation2000]. Those involved with the young person,
such as teachers, are involved throughout
[@kennedyEffectiveConsultationEducational2009a]. By recording the
consultations, the authors could gather data from a larger number of
consultations than they could have if they sat in on every consultation.
However, there was a low granularity of analysis. The researchers only
assessed whether features of the espoused theory appeared at all during
the consultation. Thus, the analysis only shows that during a
consultation, EPs brought in ideas from their espoused theory at least
once. There was no analysis of how frequently the ideas appeared and
when during the consultations. It therefore cannot tell us how great a
part these concepts from the espoused theory played in the consultation,
merely that they were present.

@nolanProcessPsychologicalConsultation2014 observed seven consultations
between five EPs, a teacher, and at least one parent. A week later, the
researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with all EPs and
teachers and some of the parents. Several key themes arose from the
observations and interviews. These were: empowering those involved in
the consultation; working collaboratively; the importance of each
participant in the consultation recognising the valuable knowledge from
others; reviewing outcomes; and EPs using their expertise to support
others (without emphasising their role as the "expert"). The use of both
observation and interview generates a lot of data about these 7
consultations, giving a very detailed understanding of the process. It
also allows corroboration between data collection methods. However, the
small sample size limits the generalisability of the findings. These
results therefore need to be replicated with different configurations of
participants and in other school settings.

@ofarrellResearchExploringParents2018 found teachers appreciated
consultation as they felt empowered to support the pupils who had been
referred. According to @jonesRefocusingEducationPsychology1990, this
empowering of consultees rather than fixing the consultees problems or
simply giving advice, is part of the definition of consultation.
@dennisFarGoodQualitative2004 found that EPs and SENCOs saw several key
issues relating to the successful implementation of a consultation
model: the EP having a detailed knowledge of the system (school) they
were working in; addressing issues at multiple levels (rather than just
on the individual level); positive relationships between the EP and
SENCO; and empowering staff to successfully fix their problems, rather
than doing it for them.

@dickinsonConsultationAssuringQuality2000a &
@munroAnglesDevelopingConsultation2000 examined how consultation had
been implemented in their EPS (Lincolnshire and Buckinghamshire
respectively). Behaviours and approaches which helped support the
successful implementation of consultation across both EPS included:
having purposeful conversations; EPs using their psychological knowledge
during consultations; and all parties involved deciding on interventions
as well as reviewing past and current interventions. Factors that were
only reported in @munroAnglesDevelopingConsultation2000 included:
engaging in preventative work; improving outcomes; and engaging in
multi-level collaborative work. Unfortunately, these papers are based on
the author's reflections on the implementation of consultation in their
LA and do not give the views of anyone else or provide much in the way
of data to support their findings. Readers must therefore take them at
their word.

This research builds on a previous piece of work by the lead researcher.
This first work explored what EPs believe the key features of a
consultation are and what happened in an initial consultation between at
least an EP and a school staff member. This was done through a novel
questionnaire asking EPs to rank features of consultation according to
their importance and thematically analysing transcripts of
consultations. During the consultations, the two most frequent features
of consultation were 'Understanding the presenting problem' and 'Working
together to come up with solutions'. EPs rated these as core features of
consultation in the questionnaire, as well as improving outcomes for
young people. Whilst this research assessed what EPs believe the core
features are and what the features are of an initial consultation, the
small sample size (3 observed consultations and 8 EPs completing the
questionnaire) means the results are hard to generalise beyond the
immediate consultations.

Although these studies typically only focused on a small number of
participants, the consistency in results allows fundamental features of
consultation to be gleaned. The studies also cover a wide range of EPS,
so the results are not limited to a specific region. This increases the
generalisability of the findings. However, despite these consistencies,
there is still a great deal of heterogeneity in consultation models and
practice. EPs can state they are engaging in consultation, but without
more information or a previously established working relationship, those
involved (parents, teachers, etc.) are unlikely to know what to expect
with a consultation. An arguably more serious consequence is that
assessing the efficacy of consultation is very difficult. If
consultations are not ergodic due to the very wide range of features,
any assessment of consultation may not be valid for consultations
performed by an individual EP. Therefore, assessing the efficacy of
consultations is difficult. This is against the backdrop of EPs working
within 'traded services' [@leeExplorationDevelopingRole2017], where the
ability to demonstrate efficacy is highly valued. It therefore behoves
EPs to gain an understanding of the consistent features of consultation.
This will allow some assessment of which combination of features are
sufficient to lead to improved outcomes for CYP.

### 1.1.6 Assessing the efficacy of consultation

There have been calls for assessing the efficacy of EP work for decades,
such as @clineQualityAssuranceEducational1994a, but this has become even
more important since the almost complete shift to 'traded services'
[@nationalcollegeforteachingandleadershipEducationalPsychologyWorkforce2014].
'Traded services' marks a shift in funding towards existing service
organisations needing to generate income from schools (seen as
customers) to either partially or fully financially support itself
[@woodsPreparationPractitionerEducational2014]. Many EPs feel a pressure
from schools to both provide something tangible for customers and to
demonstrate the effectiveness of their work, so schools buy their
services again [@leeExplorationDevelopingRole2017]. EPs are also
expected to use evidence-based tools and to critically evaluate their
practice [@britishpsychologicalsocietyQualityStandardsEducational2015,
Standard 4.8;
@healthcareprofessionscouncilStandardsProficiencyPractitioner2015a,
Standard 12.1] as part of the requirements of practising as an EP. It is
therefore very important for EPs to understand what aspects of
consultation are effective in eliciting change.

Measuring such change is difficult. As
@kennedyEducationalPsychologistsWalk2008a notes, due to the complex
nature of the interactions between consultant, consultee, and client it
is difficult to decide what to measure and how to do so. Several methods
have been put forward but none have gained ascendancy yet. One method
used by some EPS [@hampshireepsHowEducationalPsychology2010] is the
Target Monitoring Evaluation [@dunsmuirEvidenceBasedPractice2009].
Target Monitoring Evaluation (TME) is based on Goal Attainment Scaling
(GAS), which was developed by @kiresukGoalAttainmentScaling1968 to
evaluate the outcomes of mental health interventions. TME is a
streamlined form of GAS, with the added advantage of increased
granularity in evaluating progress in relation to expected progress. TME
involves the negotiated development of SMART goals (specific,
measurable, achievable, realistic, and time limited) between the EP and
the consultees. TME forms were completed by both EPs at two Local
Authorities and assistant EPs in one County. During the initial
consultation, after the goals had been decided upon, each participant
rated how far along on a 10-point scale the child currently was towards
each goal. They then stated how far they expected the child to be when
they had their review consultation. 6-8 weeks later, during the review
consultation, each participant rated how far the child had actually
progressed, which was compared with how far they were predicted to
progress. Interviews were conducted with teachers, SENCOs, and
headteachers, who gave positive feedback on the easy and efficiency of
the process, as well as how the tool helped focus on setting of targets.
Two of those interviewed had experience with GAS and stated they
preferred TME. Focus groups of EPs and assistant EPs elicited positive
views towards the tool, as well as considerations of implementation.

This pilot study gives evidence for TMEs efficacy in assessing progress
in response to EP intervention. However, the limited detail provided in
the report means we do not have a fine grained understanding of the
strengths and weaknesses of the tool. @monsenEvaluationPreTraining2009
assessed the efficacy of assistant EPs using TME and focus groups with
stakeholders. Both measures found assistant EPs to be beneficial to EP
work. This work was conducted in one EPS, therefore the generalisability
of the findings are limited. TME is a quantitative assessment of
efficacy and the focus groups produced qualitative data, comparison of
efficacy between the two measures is difficult. We therefore cannot draw
strong conclusions about the validity of TME when assessing educational
psychology work.

There have been a few studies which have attempted to compare TME with
other quantitative measures of change, such as
@connorTargetMonitoringEvaluation2010. In this thesis, the author
compared TME with other, more established forms of progress measurement
in domains like reading, such as the York Assessment of Reading
Comprehension (YARC). They report that there was broad agreement between
the TME and other forms of assessment; when other forms of assessment
found improvement, this was reflected in the reported change through the
TME forms. However, while TME may be useful for identifying progress in
individual children, it was not clear how it could be used to assess the
quality of the work from the EP. There were also some difficulties
regarding the use of it, as there was disagreement between some
consultants and consultees regarding target setting and the voice of the
child.

A recent paper [@eddlestonUsingProfessionalPractice2018] comparing
different consultation evaluation tools excluded TME because it did not
reach the inclusion criteria. Here, TMEs streamlined nature counted
against it as it was not sufficiently thorough enough to be evaluated.
This means there is limited evidence for its efficacy as a tool.
However, as @dunsmuirEvidenceBasedPractice2009 states, "the strengths of
GAS are maintained but the TME system is more streamlined and user
friendly" (p 67). We can therefore have increased confidence in the
validity of TME as a measure of change, given that GAS has been shown to
be a useful tool [@roachGoalAttainmentScaling2005] and it shares
fundamental similarities.

### 1.1.7 Local Offer literature

To gain an understanding of what EPs at different LAs understood
consultation to be, the Local Offer literature was examined. This
information was found on the LA's websites and detailed what services
the EPS provided. Despite almost all services having moved to a
consultation-based service delivery
[@dinkmeyerConsultationCreatingSchoolBased2016], over a third of LAs did
not explicitly mention consultation. Of those that did, the most
commonly cited feature was working with relevant parties, such as
teachers. The second most common was improving outcomes for the CYP,
with the importance of looking for solutions (including the use of
Solution-Focused approaches) also being mentioned frequently. What this
shows is that for the LAs that mention it, the EPs working there have
explicitly stated the importance of collaborating with those closest to
the CYP and the necessity of improving the CYP's outcomes.

## 1.2 Context and rationale

This project was greatly shaped by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic
and the subsequent response by the British Government. Because of this,
the research was conducted during unprecedented circumstances. All EPs
(and workers in general) had to work remotely from home. This presented
unique concerns for how EPs worked, as they were not allowed to see any
adults or CYP in person. Several documents, such as
@bhardwajRapidLiteratureReview2020, and one piece of research
[@aepSurveyEffectsCovid192020] were disseminated drain this time,
detailing guidance as to how EPs can work ethically within the context
of a lockdown. This included conducting consultations using either
phones or video call software, such as Microsoft Teams or Zoom. There
were concerns regarding the safety and privacy of Zoom technology
[@paulZoomMalwareWhy2020] so Teams was encouraged by many EPS. This
shifted the manner in which the research could be conducted:
consultations could not be observed in person and many EPs were not
engaging in consultation. The timeline of the research was changed as a
result, with the observation of consultations pushed back to September
2020 when it was hoped they would resume by.

The purpose of this research was it gain an insight into what EPs
believe are the effective features of consultation, why they believe
they are effective, what happens during an EP-led consultation, and
which features are seen when compared to rated progress towards agreed
goals. Gaining an understanding of what EPs believe are the core
features of consultation are allows EPs to understand what is essential
for a consultation to occur. Exploring what they believe are the
effective features and why can help guide future EPs to increase the
efficacy of their consultations.

Having a more fine-grained understanding of when different feature are
seen and how frequently would provide valuable insight into what are the
core feature of a consultation. This could then be cross-referenced with
the ratings of progress as measured by TME. It can also be used to
explore how accurate EPs are in their judgements as to what they think
are effective features of consultation. The correspondence between
observed features and progress is important because all EPS are expected
to be able to demonstrate efficacy. This efficacy is generally conceived
of as improvement for the CYP the EP is working with
[@connorTargetMonitoringEvaluation2010]. It is therefore important that
EPs can substantiate claims of efficacy for certain methods, such as
consultation. This is why the present study seeks to draw a link between
what features occur in consultations and are seen with rated progress.
By understanding what the core features of consultation are and which
features make it effective, this will inform the professions
understanding of what is required for a consultation to occur and how to
increase the chances of engaging in consultations which lead to positive
outcomes for CYP.

Mixed methods was chosen because of the desire to explore the phenomenon
(effective consultations) more completely than a single methodology
could provide [@robsonRealWorldResearch2015]. Mixed methods have been
previously used to examine consultation at different levels and
respecting the complexity of the systems it is used in, for example
[@bennAnalysisInstructionalConsultants2008]. The method chosen for the
quantitative approach was observations. This is because of the value of
observing real world consultations and systematically examining the
features present. Previous arguments have been made that the qualitative
exploration of consultation is insufficient; observation of real world
consultations is essential to accurately examine this process
[@henning-stoutConsultationConnectedKnowing1994]. Mixed methods also
help to offset the weaknesses of each approach and increase the strength
of possible inferences [@robsonRealWorldResearch2015]. The most
appropriate qualitative tool to accompany the observation is interviews,
as this is one of the best tools to thoroughly explore the views of
those who are most knowledgeable about the phenomenon
[@meyersQualitativeMixedMethods2014]. As such, EPs were interviewed to
gain an understanding of their views of the effective features of
consultation as they have first-hand experience of when consultations
are and are not effective. Equal weighting will be given to each form of
evidence and each can be used to inform the other and provide more
depth.

## 1.3 Research questions

Given the lack of strong theory in this area of research, research
questions were developed but statistical hypotheses could not be drawn.
Thus, it is exploratory research
[@kimmelmanDistinguishingExploratoryConfirmatory2014]. The general aim
of this research was to identify, through observations and interviews,
what the key features of consultations that lead to change for CYP are.
This was done by asking EPs what they believed the effective features of
consultation are, what makes them effective, and then observing
consultations and systematically noting which features occurred. This
allowed the comparison of said features with progress towards agreed
goals for various CYP and whether they reflected the views of EPs. As
such, the research questions (RQs) were:

1.  What are the core features of an effective consultation?

    i)  What do EPs believe are the key features of an effective
        consultation?

    ii) What do EPs believe are the barriers to effective consultation?

    iii) What do EPs believe makes those features effective?

2.  Which combination of features of consultation are seen with progress
    towards agreed goals?

# 2 Methodology

## 2.1 Epistemology and research paradigm

To explore these questions, a mixed methodology was employed, making use
of quantitative and qualitative research methods. It was informed by a
scientific realism epistemology. Scientific realism can help approach
difficult problems in social science as it takes into account the
complexity of the situation in which they occur
[@houseRealismResearch1991]. It can be viewed as a pragmatic approach
[@robsonRealWorldResearch2015] as it is less concerned with
philosophical dualisms, such as rationalism versus empiricism, and more
with practical considerations of issues and potential solutions
[@johnsonMixedMethodsResearch2004a]. Mixed methodology aligns with a
pragmatic approach as it is not beholden to one method of exploring a
research topic; it sees the benefits of both for exploring a research
question in different ways [@denscombeCommunitiesPracticeResearch2008].
Multiple methods of inquiry were employed because it is generally
believed using different means to explore research questions brings
greater rigour [@creswellResearchDesignQualitative2003a]. Data can be
triangulated with one another, with evidence corroborating, refuting, or
adding nuance to each other and increasing confidence in ones findings
[@munafoRobustResearchNeeds2018]. Mixed methodology research designs can
be divided along a key dimension: paradigm emphasis
[@johnsonMixedMethodsResearch2004a]. This refers to whether one strand
of the research (quantitative or qualitative) is given greater emphasis
during analysis. Because equal weight was placed on both forms of
inquiry, this was an 'equal weight' paradigm emphasis piece. An explicit
account of the ways in which the qualitative and quantitative arms of
the research relate to one another will be given.

## 2.2 Participants

Ethical approval was obtained from UCL the Institute of Education's
Ethical Committee. The inclusion criteria for both arms of the research
was: an EP or TEP who used consultation as part of their practice. There
were no requirements as to how frequently or recently it had to be used,
nor experience or location. Nor were there requirements around the
definition of consultation; just that EPs believed themselves to be
engaging in consultation. This was to try and elicit a wide a range of
views on consultations from practicing EPs. For the interview and
observation, participants were recruited via the researcher's EPS.
Convenience sampling was therefore used. This was because participant
recruitment for the observation was judged to be difficult and the
researcher would have greater success by asking participants they
already had a professional relationship with. The interview also
recruited participants by sharing calls for participants on a popular
mailing list for EPs and other education professionals (EPNET) and
social media (Twitter). Participants were also asked to share the call
for participants with other EPs at their work. Thus, a mixture of
convenience and snowball sampling [@robsonRealWorldResearch2015] was
employed for the two arms of the research.

30 EPs of varying roles and locations were interviewed. Participant's
roles included TEPs, maingrade EPs, specialist EPs, senior EPs, and
Principal EPs. The participants worked in locations such as London,
Yorkshire, Wales, and the Republic of Ireland.

6 different consultations for 4 children were observed. These
consultations were led by 2 EPs. 1 was a joint home-school consultation,
2 were consultations with one parent, 1 was a consultation with two
parents, and 2 consultations involved the class teacher (see Appendix A
for a full breakdown of which consultations involved which EPs and
consultees and were for which children).

## 2.3 Materials

All materials, along with raw data, are released under a CC-BY license,
thus allowing re-use of materials and improving reproducibility and
transparency [@nosekScientificUtopiaII2012a]. They can be accessed at:
<https://osf.io/6px7q/> in the 'Methods' folder. Almost all materials
and software used were Free/Libre and Open Source Software
[@stallmanFLOSSFOSS2016].

### 2.3.1 Interviews

A semi-structured interview format was used because an interview
schedule was developed (Appendix B) which served as a checklist of areas
to be explored with a given question order and wording. However, the
order and wording was allowed to change given the flow of the interview.
Additional questions were used to further develop a interviewee's answer
[@robsonRealWorldResearch2015]. Semi-structured interviews were chosen
because the researcher conducted all the interviews and could thus
explore answers in greater detail given their knowledge of the area.
However, given this intimacy with the research questions and purpose of
the study, there is a risk the researcher may ask leading questions to
further a certain outcome. Thus, the core questions were agreed prior to
the first interview to try and minimise bias.

The interviews were of the focused type as the questions centred around
the key theme of consultation [@mertonFocusedInterviewManual1990]. The
core of this theme related to why EPs use consultation, what EPs believe
the key features of consultation are, why they are effective, what the
barriers to consultation are, and what is the unique contribution of
consultation. Barriers were explored because exploring this can help
reveal what the effective features of consultation are as often barriers
are a lack of an effective feature or the opposite of an effective
feature.

Probes (interview devices to elicit more information) were employed by
the researcher to further develop the interviewee's responses. To
achieve this, 'laddering questions' (questions phrased in a variety of
ways asking for the interviewee to expand on their answer) and
'summarising techniques' (summarising what has just been said by the
interviewee to prompt more information), as well as 'addition probes' to
maintain the flow of the conversation
[@zeiselInquiryDesignEnvironment2006].

### 2.3.2 Observation

#### 2.3.2.1 Systematic observation

The quantitative arm of the research involved systematic observations of
consultations between an EP and either the parent, class teacher, or
both. Thus, it was a naturalistic observation as the participants were
observed in their typical environment without any interference from the
researcher [@viglioccoTipofthetonguePsychology2001]. Observation was
chosen as it helps overcome the often recorded discrepancy between what
people say they do and how they behave in the real-world. This has been
reported in such wide-ranging fields as smartphone use
[@andrewsSelfReportToolsCompare2015a] to driving behaviours
[@kayeComparisonSelfreportObjective2018].

Systematic observation was chosen because of the previous research
identifying features of consultation. The researcher therefore judged
that all the relevant observable features had been identified prior to
data collection. These observable features were developed into a coding
scheme (see Appendix C for the definition of each feature) to identify
categories over the course of a set period of time. The categories were
defined and operationalised prior to data collection
[@crollSystematicClassroomObservation1986]. They were derived from the
relevant literature and were mutually exclusive. The categories were
limited to what was explicitly said because this would help reduce the
amount of interpretation needed for behaviours such as non-verbal
interactions. Models of consultation, such as Solution-focused and
problem-analysis, were broken down into their constituent observable
parts, such as exploring strengths and identifying exceptions. Commonly
cited concepts in the literature such as 'collaborative' were split into
explicit examples of those concepts, such as Everyone's contributions
valued.

Event sampling was used as the absolute and relative frequency of events
was of interest [@robsonRealWorldResearch2015]. A sequence record was
also used to provide information as to the order in which the features
were seen, thus providing information about transitions
[@robsonRealWorldResearch2015]. Time sampling was not chosen so no
events were missed because they fell outside of the time intervals.
However, the length of time each feature occurred for was lost. Whilst
this information would be valuable to see how long each feature lasted
for, rather than just how frequently it occurred, it was decided that
the risk of missing feature due to the researcher focusing on correctly
marking the time of each feature outweighed the benefit of gaining that
information.

The categories are defined and operationalised prior to data collection
[@crollSystematicClassroomObservation1986]. They were derived from the
relevant literature and were mutually exclusive. This was to increase
the reliability as it reduces the chances of observations being coded
differently according to the interpretation of an observer. To further
reduce risks to reliability, the categories were limited to what was
explicitly said. Thus, features were defined as utterances by
participants within the consultation. This was done to minimise the
amount of inference the researcher had to use when deciding whether a
category was observed [@crollSystematicClassroomObservation1986]. Models
of consultation, such as Solution-focused, were broken down into their
constituent observable parts, such as exploring strengths and
identifying exceptions, so the categories were more fine-grained and
which specific features of the models were used during consultations.

#### 2.3.2.2 TME

A TME form (Appendix D) will be used to assess progress towards goals
that were agreed by all those in the consultation. TME was chosen
because it is designed to fit in with the consultation framework
[@dunsmuirEvidenceBasedPractice2009]. Its streamlined nature allowed it
to be incorporated into the observed consultations with minimal
disruption to the flow of the consultation. This was valuable as the EPs
observed did not use TME as a typical step in their practice currently,
although they had in the past. Therefore, to preserve the integrity of
the observation, as little disruption by the research as possible was
sought.

Another issue with TME is that it is used as a tool to assess the
efficacy of consultation but many events occur between the baseline and
actual rating. Many of these events will not be as a result of the
consultation and the implementation of interventions agreed in the
consultation will typical not be orchestrated by the EP
[@gutkinSchoolBasedConsultation1999], so how much progress can be
attributed to the consultation is unknown.

The reliability and validity of TME are also in question.
@dunsmuirEvidenceBasedPractice2009 state that the reliability of GAS has
been demonstrated, for example @kaplanUseAttainmentScaling1977.
@dunsmuirEvidenceBasedPractice2009 assume validity of TME if the goals
aligns with the recommendations from
@cardilloIllustrationsGoalSetting1994. However, reliability and validity
cannot be transferred from one measure to another, even if the latter is
derived from the former [@flakeConstructValidationSocial2017].
Researchers have also cautioned against using single-item measures for
constructs [@diamantopoulosGuidelinesChoosingMultiItem2012]. There have
also been recent analyses of the validity of GAS which judged that there
is "insufficient information to assess the validity of GAS"
[@gaasterlandSystematicReviewInvestigate2016]. Therefore, the
suitability of TME as a means to measure progress is called into
question. However, it was judged to be suitable because it allows the
specification of goals to the needs of individual participants. However,
the strength of the conclusions drawn on the effect consultation has on
progress towards the goals was reduced because of the concerns around
validity and reliability.

## 2.4 Procedure

Prior to data collection, it was decided the quantitative arm would be
conducted first, starting in March 2020 and continuing until March 2021.
Interviews would be conducted in the autumn of 2020. Thus, a concurrent
triangulation design would be employed
[@creswellResearchDesignQualitative2003a]. Both the quantitative and
qualitative arms of the research would be conducted simultaneously and
independently. The results were to be compared to see whether the
conclusions drawn align with one another. This was done for practical
rather than philosophically informed reasons. It was agreed beforehand
that collecting observation data would be more difficult, as finding
consultations with all the required participants who were also willing
to be observed is unlikely. It was therefore felt that having a longer
window of opportunity to collect data was the reasonable course of
action.

However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic all in person consultations were
cancelled across the U.K. to comply with the government-mandated
lockdown [@cabinetofficeStayingHomeAway2020]. Whilst many EPs offered
consultations to their respective schools, most found they delivered far
fewer consultations during the lockdown than usual. Those who delivered
consultations typically did so via the phone, eliminating any chance of
observation by the researcher. In response, data collection for the
interviews was brought forward to start in March 2020 and observations
of consultations would occur once consultations could be observed by the
researcher. The research was therefore adapted to use a sequential
transformative design [@creswellResearchDesignQualitative2003a]. This
type of mixed methodology involves one method preceding the other.
Either the qualitative or the quantitative arm of the research project
is conducted first. The methodology does not require one be used before
the other, so practical reasons may determine the order of research. The
results from both strands are interpreted together, with one informing
the other.

### 2.4.1 Interviews

Interviews were originally planned to be in person with EPs in the
researcher's EPS. However, because of the global pandemic, all
non-essential in person meetings were banned. They were therefore
switched to video or phone call interviews. This necessitated a choice
in video call technology. Because of the increased familiarity of the
public, ease of use, and improved security features
[@zoomReleaseNotesApril2020], Zoom was judged to be appropriate for the
purposes of this research. Because of the sudden increase in proficiency
and willingness of many EPs to use phone and video call technology, the
parameters of the participant recruitment for the interviews was widened
to all EPs. This decision was made because of a desire to increase the
number of participants and thus the range of views on consultation.
Informed consent was gained prior to participation (see Appendix E).

Semi-structured focused interviews were used to elicit EP views with
regards to the core features of consultation, the barriers to effective
consultation, how their consultation work has changed in response to the
lockdown, and the advantages and disadvantages of this new way of
working. Participants were interviewed using a mixture of phone and
video call technology. Data collection took place between 31/03/2020 and
28/05/2020. All interviews were recorded with an Honor 10 lite phone and
an anonymous transcript made.

### 2.4.2 Observation

Observations were conducted between 20/11/2020 and 14/01/2021. After
gaining informed consent from all participants, the researcher observed
the consultation unfold as normal. The researcher used the observation
schedule to mark when and how frequently different features occurred.
These were then summed.

Immediately after the conclusion of the consultation, the participants
(EP, school class teacher, and/or parent) were asked to collectively
identify 1-3 goals for the CYP to work towards. This was done using a
TME form which the EP introduced the participants to. Goals were
suggested by the consultees or by the EP (if the consultee was unable to
think of a suitable goal). It was then agreed by all participants.
Participants rated, on a scale of 1-10, where the CYP currently was
towards that goal (by writing the letter 'B' for 'baseline' next to the
number) and where they expected them to be in 6-8 weeks (by writing the
letter 'E' by the number). In 6-8 weeks time, participants would be
contacted by the researcher via email to rate how far along the CYP had
progressed towards that goal. This judgement was represented by the
letter 'A' (for 'actual') along the same rating scale.

After the consultation, contact was made via email with the consultees
after 6 weeks. This was because it was judged that this would give
enough time for the participants to respond within the 8 week window
recommended by TME [@connorTargetMonitoringEvaluation2010]. All
consultees responded within 8 weeks. For all but child 4, this period
fell over the Christmas holidays. The upper limit was therefore chosen
to give the children as great a time as possible in school receiving
support. A second national lockdown was announced prior to the start of
the spring term. All the children except child 3 remained in school
during this lockdown.

## 2.5 Piloting methods

To ensure rigour in the methodologies employed, each methodology was
piloted prior to data collection. This was to check that the interview
questions were understandable and suitable and that the observation
schedule categories were discrete and easily interpretable.

### 2.5.1 Interview schedule

The interview was piloted with a Trainee Educational Psychologist (TEP)
to check for flow and whether the interviewees understood the questions.
The TEP commented on the definition of "features" in question 5. The
word was changed to "features" and a clarification statement developed
to be provided in the interviewees, along with a definition if required.

### 2.5.2 Observation schedule

To establish inter-rater reliability (IRR), an anonymous transcript of a
previously recorded consultation was analysed for feature using the
observation schedule. Three raters, including the researcher, assessed
the transcript for feature of consultations in their relative order.
Intraclass correlations [@shroutIntraclassCorrelationsUses1979] were
calculated between the three raters. The relative frequency of each
category was calculated for each rater and compared with one coder's
(the researchers) results. Because frequency counts were used,
intraclass correlations (ICC) were suitable as the data is continuous.
To calculate ICC, four factors must be decided upon prior to calculation
[@hallgrenComputingInterRaterReliability2012]. A two way model was used
because the raters weren't randomly selected from the population. Given
that a non-timed sequence record design was chosen for the observation
schedule, good IRR was defined as consistency in the ratings because it
was more important that raters provide scores that are similar in rank
order. A single measures ICC was calculated because the reliability of
the other two raters needed to generalise to ratings of one coder (the
researcher). And finally, a mixed model was used because the raters were
not randomly chosen from a population. This model was applied using the
irr package [@gamerIrrVariousCoefficients2019] in the statistical
programming language R [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2017].
This produced an ICC of 0.471 which, according to guidelines provided by
@cicchettiGuidelinesCriteriaRules1994 are 'fair'.

## 2.6 Data analysis

This chapter will detail the process of analysing both the qualitative
and quantitative data, including steps taken. A critique, with reference
to the relevant literature, of the reasons for these methods will also
be provided.

*It needs to be clear how the structure and content of different
instruments relates to the RQs i.e. how they will generate data to
answer these. There also needs to be more explicit justification for the
choice of methods and instruments, better detail on the content of the
latter, and a more developed account of analytical procedures.*

### 2.6.1 Interviews

The interviews were thematically analysed to explore RQ1 and its
sub-RQs. @braunUsingThematicAnalysis2006 identify 6 stages to the
process of TA: familiarizing yourself with your data; generating initial
codes; searching for themes; reviewing themes; defining and naming
themes; and producing the report. Codes were instances of features of
consultation discussed by the participants as this was the first step in
'data reduction' [@milesQualitativeDataAnalysis1994] by organising it
into meaningful groups [@tuckettApplyingThematicAnalysis2005].

#### 2.6.1.1 TA process

The anonymous transcripts were thematically analysed using the software
NVivo 12, a qualitative data analysis tool. This was done through
uploading the transcripts as text documents into the software. A mixed
or hybrid TA approach [@feredayDemonstratingRigorUsing2006] was
employed. This incorporates inductive and deductive TA. Inductive TA is
driven primarily by the data
[@boyatzisTransformingQualitativeInformation1998a] and deductive TA is
theory-driven with codes derived from said theory
[@crabtreeTemplateApproachText1992]. In NVivo, utterances by the
participants were highlighted and a deductive code was selected, an
inductive code was generated, or an inductive code was selected. As
such, the TA was "guided, but not confined, by the [deductive] codes"
[@feredayDemonstratingRigorUsing2006]. The a priori codes identified
were developed from the scientific and Local Offer literature. Inductive
codes were either classed as 'features' of consultation or 'what makes
these features of consultation effective'. For the features of
consultation, inductive codes were either words used by the interviewees
that related to features of consultation that they believed were
effective or were features that shared a common idea. One such example
is "exploration" and "different perspectives" having the core idea of
discussing a topic from a variety of angles and gaining 'Different
views'. For 'what makes these features of consultation effective', these
inductive codes were derived from interviewee utterances relating to why
they believed certain features of consultation were effective.

To check the accuracy of codes and split previously identified inductive
codes into more fine grained codes, the second stage in TA was repeated
three times. This iterative process forms a key part of TA
[@riceQualitativeResearchMethods1999] and should be methodological to
ensure rigour [@attride-stirlingThematicNetworksAnalytic2001]. During
the TA process, transcripts were regularly checked against the
recordings to ensure accuracy.

A thematic map of codes was created using TikZiT, an open source project
for creating diagrams [@kissingerTikZiT2019]. This was to visually
represent all the codes and aid in the generation of themes.
@boyatzisTransformingQualitativeInformation1998a defines a theme as a
pattern contained within one's data which summarises the observations
through description. This helps to interpret the explored phenomenon.
Semantic themes (that which is explicitly said) were found and analysed
[@boyatzisTransformingQualitativeInformation1998a] with interpretation
of their significance and implications
[@pattonQualitativeEvaluationResearch1990]. TA identified 32 inductive
codes, as well as the 15 deductive codes previously set, relating to
what features EPs believed were effective for consultation. 6 codes were
identified for what made said features effective (see Appendix F for the
definitions of the inductive codes, Appendix G for the definitions of
the codes relating to what makes the features effective and Appendix H
for the breakdown of the number of interviews which each code was
identified in and the total number of codes for each feature). These
were combined to create 8 themes: Buy-in, Conditions, Context,
Strengths-based, Shared understanding, Intervention, Future facing, and
EP skills and knowledge. These could then be combined to create two
overarching themes: Internal factors (features relating to the factors
endemic to a consultation) and External factors (features relating to
things happening around a consultation).

There was no direct correspondence between the deductive and inductive
codes of the features of consultation to what makes those features
effective. This was for two reasons. First, because many interviewees
talked in more general terms as to why consultation was effective,
rather than limiting their focus to the discussion of specific features.
Secondly, because of the vagueness of many of the terms used by the
interviewees, such as "collaborative" and "clarity". However, some links
can be made between them (see Appendix I) and the codes relating to
'what makes the features of consultation effective'.

#### 2.6.1.2 Critique of TA

TA was chosen because it is flexible since it is not bound to a
phenomenological epistemology, such as methods like Interpretative
Phenomenological Analysis
[@smithInterpretativePhenomenologicalAnalysis2003]. Nor does it limit
one to only inductive code theme development and therefore the ignoring
of previously identified theory, such as Grounded theory
[@straussGroundedTheoryMethodology]. It is also described by
@braunUsingThematicAnalysis2006 as being "accessible" to those with less
experience in qualitative methods. Semantic themes were chosen because
the focus of this research is on the features of consultation and how
they relate to effecting change for the CYP the consultations are about.
Therefore, an analysis of the "underlying ideas, assumptions, and
conceptualizations, and ideologies" [@braunUsingThematicAnalysis2006]
was not deemed an appropriate level of analysis.

However, because of the reduced depth of analysis performed during TA,
important themes and ideas could be missed. As it just describes the
data, it arguably has "limited analytical and interpretative properties"
[@eddlestonActionResearchStudy2016]. This lack of depth gives TA its
flexibility, but it runs the risk of being biased which undermines
validity [@willigIntroducingQualitativeResearch2008]. To counter this,
all the data will be made publicly available to allow independent
analysis and critique [@smithGuidelinesCleanData1986].

### 2.6.2 Observations

6 observations were conducted for 4 children. After the tabulation of
features of consultation using the observation schedule, the number of
features across each consultation was summed. Qualitative notes were
made on the demeanour and enthusiasm of the consultees. The data from
the TME forms for all goals was collected and a value of 'change' was
calculated for each consultation. This was done by subtracting the
'baseline' rank from the 'actual' as research suggests most TME forms
report a positive change as a result of the consultation
[@dunsmuirEvidenceBasedPractice2009; @monsenEvaluationPreTraining2009].
To explore the relationship between the presence of features and
reported change, Qualitative Comparison Analysis (QCA) was used, with
the QCA package for R [@dusaQCAComprehensiveResource2018]. QCA allows
the comparison of cases with the "help of formal tools and with a
specific conception of cases" [@rihouxCaseQualitativeComparative2009].

#### 2.6.2.1 QCA process

The foundation of QCA involves the identification of cases, conditions,
and an outcome. Each consultation forms a QCA case, the theoretically
derived features of consultation are the conditions, and the difference
between 'baseline' and 'actual' is the outcome. QCA involves the
analysis of the frequency of different conditions to explore which
combination of conditions (both presence and absence) led to a measured
outcome variable.

QCA is based on Boolean algebra and set theory. Conditions are
identified and can either be 'present' or 'absent' and sets are formed
based on combinations of these conditions being present or absent. QCA
flattens the data according to theoretically derived thresholds so
combinations of conditions can be compared. The final step of QCA is
Boolean minimisation where complex expressions of conditions which
produce the same outcome are reduced to simpler expressions.

#### 2.6.2.2 Crisp-set QCA

Crisp-set QCA [@raginComparativeMethodMoving1987] was used as the
features were mutually exclusive and bivalent; they could be classed as
either 'present' or 'absent'. After establishing the outcome and
conditions, @marxCrispSetQualitativeComparative2011 give the following
stages for crisp-set QCA:

1.  convert the outcome and conditions into binary conditions;
2.  code each case for each conditions separately;
3.  check the truth table for contradictory configurations;
4.  analyse the model and interpret after deriving parsimonious
    solutions.

Given this framework, the raw scores were then calibrated so the
conditions were either classed as 'present' or 'absent' for each case
[@dusaQCAComprehensiveResource2018]. The threshold was defined as the
mean, which is one method suggested by @thiemCrispSetQCA2013 when
plotting the data does not provide clear thresholds or there is not a
theoretical justification for a threshold. Therefore, cases where the
number of observations of the condition was greater than the mean were
classed as 'present'. Cases where the number of observations of the
condition was less than the mean were classed as 'absent'. Any condition
which does not vary at all (either it is always present or absent) was
excluded as it is a constant
[@rihouxConfigurationalComparativeMethods2009a]. This creates a
dichotomous data table [@rihouxConfigurationalComparativeMethods2009a]
which can be non-formally analysed to explore patterns of conditions
relating to the presence of the outcome.

After this calibration, a truth table is created to systematically
examine the combinations of different causal conditions to the presence
or absence of the outcome
[@balodiConfigurationsEntrepreneurialOrientation2016]. A truth table
represents all the possible combinations of causal conditions seen in
the data. Each row is a distinct configuration and may contain one or
more case. Configurations can be classed as "1" (present), "0" (absent),
or "contradictory". Contradictory configurations (where the same
configuration of conditions leads to the same outcome) must be resolved
prior to Boolean minimisation. This is typically done by changing the
sufficiency inclusion cut-off point for the truth table to allow more
combinations of features, such that there aren't any contradictory
configurations [@dusaQCAComprehensiveResource2018]. Sufficiency for
inclusion is also calculated, which gives a score as to whether the
combination is sufficient for the outcome.

To establish whether a configuration can be combined Boolean
minimisation is used. This can be summarised as: "if two Boolean
expressions differ in only one causal condition yet produce the same
outcome, then the causal condition that distinguishes the two
expressions can be considered irrelevant and can be removed to create a
simpler, combined expression" [@raginComparativeMethodMoving1987]. This
therefore provides the simplest combination of conditions from the data
which lead to the outcome.

#### 2.6.2.3 Critique of QCA

QCA is characterised as a "small-N-many variables" approach
[@lijphartIIComparableCasesStrategy1975] because it is used when there
are a small number of cases but a large number of potential causal
variables. This makes it suitable to analyse the potential causal
features in relation to change because there are a small number of
observed consultations but a large number of variables (features). QCA
also does not require the researcher to specify a single causal model,
as is typical with most statistical techniques. Rather, it allows the
identification of "the number and character of the different causal
models that exist among comparable cases"
[@raginComparativeMethodMoving1987].

QCA also allows for "conjunctural causation"
[@rihouxCaseQualitativeComparative2009] as different combinations of
factors can produce the same result (equifinality). It can also reveal
causal asymmetry (configurations with the presence and absence of the
same condition leading to the presence of the outcome). Necessary and
sufficient conditions can be identified, as well as core and peripheral
conditions [@rihouxCaseQualitativeComparative2009].

# 3 Results

The subsequent chapter summarises the results from the two arms of the
thesis. The layout will follow the structure of the RQs, with the
interview data presented first to explore what interviewees believe are
the effective features of consultation. The observation data will then
be presented to gain an understanding of what features are seen in
consultations, which consultations saw change for the CYP, and which
features were necessary or sufficient for the observed change.

## 3.1 Interviews

The thematic map of codes and features (see Figure 1) was derived from
analysing the codes for similarities around their nature to give themes
[@braunUsingThematicAnalysis2006]. For example, the essence of codes
such as 'collaborative' and 'contributions valued' related to the
consultees viewing the consultation as a good use of their time and
believing that it would lead to change for the CYP. This buy-in was
linked to the outcomes and suggestions from the consultation being
realistic, as consultees would be more likely to do what had been
suggested and believe it would have a positive impact. By treating the
consultee as an expert in their area of knowledge, this would help
increase their buy-in to the process of consultation and be more willing
to engage.

EP skills and knowledge was identified as many of the effective features
of consultation were related to the EP having expert knowledge of viable
solutions or through their understanding of psychological models. These
all increased the efficacy of consultation. Through EP skill with
regards to their expert knowledge and ability to ask questions, for
example, consultation could be an efficient means to enact change.
Consultation also allowed for EP skill to be shown by being a flexible
model of working, such that EPs could a wide range of their skills and
knowledge to help CYP.

Shared understanding was identified as these features all related to the
gathering of different views to ensure everyone involved had an
understanding of the situation. This was aided through the EP using
clear language and documenting what had happened during a consultation.

Intervention as a theme related to the fact a consultation itself could
be an intervention. By actively changing the perspectives of consultees
in the consultation, change could follow from this. Consultation can
also be a vehicle to support consultees emotionally and therefore help
CYP through their emotional needs being met. And consultation was
identified as being a part of the assessment process and as such is a
form of intervention in that way.

Strengths-based was identified as a theme as three codes directly
related to building on the strengths of those involved and the CYP. This
was through upskilling the consultees and reminding them of the relevant
attributes they already possess, as well as highlighting what was
already going well for the CYP and what strengths they have.

What follows is a more detailed description of each constituent code.

### 3.1.1 Buy-in

This theme related to the importance of EPs creating a bond with those
involved, including the consultee(s) and other school staff members not
directly involved in the consultation, and using this relationship to
facilitate change.

#### 3.1.1.1 Collaborative

One of the fundamental and most oft cited features for creating buy-in
was making consultation collaborative. Within the consultation, this was
achieved through a variety of factors. One of the key ones was making
sure there was equal participation, such that everyone had a voice and
different perspectives were heard: *"effective consultation shouldn't
being a meeting where one person dominates, whether that may be a
psychologist or anyone else"* (Interview 11) and *"it's like we're all
involved, we're all at the same level, we just come at it from a
different perspective"* (Interview 7).

As a result of there being equal participation, there is a greater
chance that everyone involved has the same understanding of the
situation and the CYP: *"to bring everyone together, and to co-create
and co-construct a shared narrative"* (Interview 11). Misunderstandings
can be cleared up (Interview 5) and these help everyone feel involved in
the process and ensure that the consultation is collaborative. The
creation of a shared narrative can also include the the creation of a
shared agenda. This helps guide the consultation so it is more effective
as it is meeting the needs of those involved and everyone agrees to it:
*"I think a really fundamentally important part of that consultation is
ensuring that we do have that shared agenda; we know why we're there
together and we all agree what we're doing there together"* (Interview
24) and *"to arrive at a joint action plan, joint for the school and the
parents, school are always involved as well, so it's more
collaborative"* (Interview 10).

This shared agenda can be established by identifying what everyone is
hoping to get from the consultation:

> *...it would always start with a question about what are your best
> hopes from our meeting together? What are your best hopes from our
> work together? Because if we don't start with that question, erm, then
> we don't know where we're trying to get to. (Interview 27)*

By working collaboratively with those involved, EPs can facilitate
collaboration between the home and school. This can potentially support
both by helping maintain morale and creating a sense of shared
responsibility:

> *...there is something that goes on often, not always, in the room
> when you've got the family, and school together, the, you do you do
> bring that sense of, 'We are working on this together; you are not
> alone school in this, you are not alone parents in this, we are doing
> this together'. (Interview 5)*

#### 3.1.1.2 Contributions valued

A related code, and one which can facilitate a collaborative
consultation, is the idea that everyone who is present in the
consultation should feel able to contribute. Not only this, but they
need to believe that what they say will be taken on board:

> *...where I would like to think that their views, their knowledge,
> their understanding is just as valid as mine... we are equal
> participants in this. (Interview 13)*

> *...equal participation, you know, as far as possible, or that
> everybody participates and that everybody feels valued, everybody
> feels that what they had to say is useful. (Interview 20)*

This can help give power to those who may not typically have it in the
school environment, thus helping create a more level playing field and
therefore a more collaborative consultation: *"schools are by nature
very hierarchical. So if you've got a TA they're often not seen as the
same as... a SENCO or a head teacher's views but in that situation they
are".* (Interview 1)

#### 3.1.1.3 Encouraging engagement

Removing power dynamics within a consultation was seen by many
participants as an important part of the EPs role within consultation.
This formed part of the code 'EP encouraging engagement'. The EP must
try and create a space so no consultee feels intimidated and in which
all relevant people can contribute, even if they cannot physically be
present:

> *...the psychologist trying to level power dynamics is a really key, a
> really key part of any consultation and that erm that's in relation to
> ourselves, as a professional with a doctorate normally, but also in
> relation to the family and the teacher, or the family and the school.
> (Interview 2)*

> *...balance of people's voices in the rooms. So, erm, making time for
> those that might not be able to be present in the meeting to hear
> their views and voices. (Interview 27)*

This code related to any effort by the EP to attempt to include the
voices of the relevant parties. One of the ways that this is through
*"active listening"* (Interview 1). A key idea related to the EP
facilitating others to participate:

> *I'm there to help facilitate the group in thinking about ways
> forward. (Interview 15)*

> *...giving a space where people can listen to other people's
> perspectives, then you take away the bulk of what it is that you're,
> erm, using to try and make a difference. (Interview 21)*

Not only does the EP need to facilitate others, but also challenge
potentially harmful narratives and navigate difficult situations:

> *Being careful and being prepared to challenge. (Interview 25)*

> *...sometimes a kind of mediation role because... we work in complex
> and messy situations. And it's not always that people are going to
> agree, or even really want to hear what they have to say. So there's
> that kind of control in the, the floor that happens in a consultation,
> which doesn't happen in other types of conversation. (Interview 3)*

Being able to read body language was identified by a few EPs as being
important for facilitating engagement:

> *you try to do an online meeting, you lose the gesticulations, you
> lose... being able to point at things or being able to... look at
> their faces better and realise, 'Oh, they're not understanding, I need
> to change the way I'm explaining it' or something. I think you lose so
> much because it's that non-verbal feedback that you get, that allows
> you to know where you are at with the relationship, to know the way
> you can develop within that consultation. (Interview 24)*

However, this was not universal. A few EPs found that using
technologically-mediated (tech) consultations did not lead to a decrease
in quality of the relationship. One EP experienced her consultees asking
for telephone consultations and that these were effective (Interview
16).

#### 3.1.1.4 Rapport

The difference between in-person and tech consultations relates to
another core feature, which is the development of a rapport with those
involved in consultations. Within the consultation, an EP must quickly
develop a rapport so that the consultees feel comfortable talking about
potentially difficult topics:

> *...trust and credibility and shared mutual respect, I think are at
> the core of any consultation. You know, they value what I offer
> because I'm in touch and the fact they get on well with me, that
> almost therapeutic relationship. (Interview 7)*

> *...built up that trust and sense of safety, that it's okay to express
> their worries, that you can get quite a lot of information. (Interview
> 10)*

The EP needs to not only develop a rapport with those involved, but
encourage relationships between consultees: *"building attuned
interactions in a meeting with parents, with teachers, and then
hopefully between them as well. It just kind of gets everyone on the
same page, hopefully gets everyone pointing in the right direction"*
(Interview 30). This is especially important when relationships between
the home and school have broken down: *"sometimes you have a breakdown
between parents and the school... you can be a person in between, and
try and get that working through that... which is... a key feature of
consultation. (Interview 4)*

Several EPs talked about the importance of having a good relationship
with the school. A good relationship between the school (generally
understood to mean at least the SECNCos and potentially Senior
Leadership Team) helps consultation to be more effective: *"If it's
going to be successful model in a school, I think the need is... time
for the EP to build a relationship with the school is important.*
(Interview 23). The reason the relationship is crucial for improving
consultation is that when the EP has developed a good relationship with
the school and they are mutually supporting one another, it is easier to
create an environment which fosters collaboration:

> *...when you know the school especially, and they're supporting you in
> supporting the parents and the staff to do that, then you see it a lot
> more". (Interview 1)*

> *...schools are often hesitant to adopt consultation as the main
> method of EP work: some of the SEN schools that I work with have a
> very rigid way of seeing the EP role and what we do, and they're,
> they're view is, more often than not, my role as an EP is to go in, do
> an assessment, write a report, and that's it. Er, so in those
> instances, I find it much harder to sell consultation as a, as a
> model. (Interview 11)*

However, several EPs spoke of using their relationship with the school
to change how they approach EP work and what the EP can do in the
school:

> *...once you build a relationship with schools, and you've been
> working in it, you can shift things, you can move things around, to,
> you know, working with a bit more control, getting them to see how,
> you know, it can be more effective, working with consultation, not
> doing just lots of assessments. (Interview 4)*

> *That's how you change it. I think that the relationship is super
> important. (Interview 23)*

#### 3.1.1.5 EP view of consultation and Consultee view of consultation

An important feature of consultation that relates to rapport is the
understanding that the consultees, EP, and school as a whole have
towards consultation. The conception EPs and consultees have of
consultation impacts on whether they buy-in to the process. If they do
not see consultation as a collaborative process, they are less likely to
engage with it in an effective way and believe it is a good use of their
time. How the EP and consultees view consultation can have a large
impact on a consultation and its efficacy. A belief shared by many
interviewees was that *"both parties... know how consultation works"*
(Interview 24) and this *"might depend on people's constructs of what
consultation is"* (Interview 29). Interviewees had an overwhelmingly
positive view of consultation, highlighting its versatility and
alignment with their values:

> *...consultation, I think, is a, is a framework with the complexity
> that matches the complexity of the concerns that are being raised.
> Erm, we're looking at concerns at an individual and a group and a
> systemic level. (Interview 21)*

> *I don't think you can be inclusive without using a consultative
> model. (Interview 25)*

Though many interviewees identified the value of consultation and the
importance of clearly understanding it and what it involves, many also
pointed out that there is a large heterogeneity of practice among EPs:
*"I think that concept of what a consultation is will vary from one EP
to another"* (Interview 24). There are also EPs who do not value it and
prefer a more traditional style of assessing CYP and then writing a
report. As one interviewee said: *"I know there's a lot of EPs out there
that continue to work in that way and I think, I think that's one of the
barriers to shifting more to a consultation framework"* (Interview 17).
One interviewee, who had recently attended a course on consultation
provided by their EPS, stated:

> *I'm not sure a lot of EPs really understand what it is. Being able to
> communicate that... even on that consultation course that I mentioned
> I went on, I was really surprised that people, people very open and
> very honest, and they said, 'We've been saying we've been using
> consultation, but we actually have not. We've realised now that we
> haven't really been using consultation'. (Interview 22)*

This makes it difficult for consultees to gain a clear understanding of
what consultation is and has led a few EPs to call for clearer
communication and *"being better at communicating... what it is and what
it can do"* (Interview 22). One of the reasons it is important
consultees understand what consultation means is so they can see the
value in it. Many interviewees described how some of the schools they
work in do not appreciate it fully:

> *...if I could click my fingers and change something on a systemic
> level, it would be the attitude toward consultation because I I really
> view them as an investment. If you invest in a consultation, you're
> going to get better work and and outcomes. Whereas, sometimes they can
> be viewed as an expensive hurdle you have to get over to get a
> standardised score. (Interview 2)*

> *I think there are some schools that, erm, have a negative view of
> consultation. Because of that. It's, it's more complex procedure I
> think, people realise. (Interview 10)*

> *I think we need to educate our schools more about 'This is what the
> process is', because we say in sales blurb 'We do a consultation' and,
> erm, and then the schools are still stuck in that, kind of, old way of
> thinking. (Interview 28)*

A recurring comment centred around the differences between primary and
secondary schools, with primaries typically being more willing to engage
with them:

> *...most primary SENCOs are very open to whatever I suggest. And
> they're quite open to different ways of working, as long as they have
> a report to use as evidence, er, for EP involvement, so it has that
> element of of a tick box. But most primary schools are very open to
> different ways of looking, I would say, but secondaries definitely
> aren't. (Interview 18)*

#### 3.1.1.6 EP view of EPs and Consultee view of EPs

Another relevant strand to the different perceptions of consultations is
how the consultees view EPs and their role. This relates to the theme of
Buy-in because if both or either party view the EP as the expert who
will fix the problem for the consultee, they will not buy-in to the
collaborative nature of the consultation. This threatens the efficacy of
the consultation. Several interviewees talked about how they were viewed
as gatekeepers to resources or as someone who would fix the situation
independently of any work by the consultees:

> *...the associations that staff or parents can have of us as being,
> kind of, the deciders of resources. So we will go in and we will say,
> and we will think we are there to support to think about what we can
> do for this child, and they will think we are coming in to say 'Yes
> you can have any EHCP [Education, Health, and Care Plan]' or 'Yes you
> can have extra money'. (Interview 1)*

> *...if school are new to that way of working and they are used to
> having an EP come in and, sort of, tell them what to do. I do notice
> that sometimes there's a bit of confusion, er, especially from some
> teachers who are, 'Why are you asking me, aren't you supposed to tell
> me what I need to do'? (Interview 11)*

The consultee view of EPs also affected how receptive a school is to
consultation because *"it very much comes down to the school's view of
my role"* (Interview 14). Several EPs talked about wanting to change the
views of the consultees in the consultation.

How the consultees view the EP can be changed in the consultation
itself: *"You're modelling how psychologists think... they might think a
psychologist is on a pedestal or whatever, but you're modelling that
psychologists are like everybody else"* (Interview 7). To help level
this power dynamic, EPs often try to present themselves as not having a
privileged position, as some interviewees talked about *"not putting
themselves in an expert position"* (Interview 27). This is because
*"It's the process of discussion itself, erm, that leads to, kind of,
outcomes, rather than taking on an expert model."* (Interview 14).
However, a few EPs pushed back against the framing of the EPs non-expert
stance as it can be counter-productive: *"I think, erm, sometimes EPs
can go too far the other way in not being the expert... it's a little
bit disingenuous, because sometimes we've got a lot of good ideas to
offer"* (Interview 27). How strongly they take on the role of the expert
was independent of the importance of most EPs placed on being empathetic
and supportive:

> *...you're in the situation as a human being, but also trying to be a
> psychologist as well, and they're quite difficult to do at the same
> time. (Interview 14)*

> *I think you need to be an ally, and a guide, but not be, 'I know what
> you should do and you should do this'. (Interview 23)*

#### 3.1.1.7 Willing to engage

A feature that almost two thirds of the interviewees identified was the
willingness of the consultees to engage in the consultation process:

> *...the effectiveness is because of engagement, critical thinking
> process thinking, and then plan your own action plans, which you're
> also engaged in. (Interview 5)*

> *...at the same time, to know that the reason that everyone is around
> the table for this consultation is to try and shift that thinking in
> some way. And usually, you know, just by nature of showing up
> everybody does want that, even if they don't necessarily believe it to
> be possible, which is why I think those features of consultation are
> effective. (Interview 3)*

> *...just general engagement from either the parents or school, and the
> willingness to, to change; the willingness to change their practice.
> (Interview 5)*

#### 3.1.1.8 Consultee ownership

Several interviewees talked about how these features are effective
because they help create a sense of consultee ownership of the
situation. By being collaborativeThe consultees are more likely to buy
into the process of consultation and are therefore more likely to feel
they can be an active agent in supporting the CYP:

> *...when people are active participants in a process, any process,
> they would be more likely to follow through with what has been agreed
> in terms of, whether that would be actions, whether that would be a
> specific approach that needs to be put in place. (Interview 11)*

> *...they retain some sense of ownership and some, er, sense of
> responsibility for putting in place what comes next. (Interview 20)*

> *...the point of that conversation is to leave something behind for
> the people who actually have power to do things and if you don't have
> their buy-in, then it's totally pointless. I'm struggling to think of
> a method, outside of consultation, where you could get that buy in and
> that information share and get to any kind of meaningful endpoint.
> (Interview 3)*

#### 3.1.1.9 Realistic

Another commonly discussed mechanism for effective consultations was the
increased chance of realistic recommendations and outcomes being
established. If the ideas generated are more co-constructed and built on
shared knowledge, they are more likely to be feasible:

> *...it also allows for reality, so if you've, you know, hopefully
> you're not getting ideas or strategies that are completely unworkable.
> So it should be based within the practice of the class teacher. So it
> isn't, you know, somebody coming in and going, 'Well, you need to do
> this three times a day with, you know, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah'.
> (Interview 21)*

> *...the feedback we get from parents that things are very grounded in
> reality, that the ideas that we're talking about makes sense because
> they come from a position of understanding and making sense of
> whatever is being brought into the room and, sort of, helping to
> manage some of the complexity. (Interview 27)*

If these suggestions are created collaboratively, then the consultees
are more likely to buy-in to the process of consultation and are more
likely to put in place the recommendations. This greatly increases the
chance of the consultation having a positive impact for the CYP.

#### 3.1.1.10 Consultees as experts

The final code from this theme relates to treating the consultees as
experts of their own area:

> *I try to make it collaborative because erm, my stance is that we all
> bring our own expertise; they're experts as parents, they're experts
> on their child. Erm and as teachers, they're experts on, you know,
> teaching that child and teaching in general. (Interview 8)*

> *I think they're effective because, we're capitalising on that idea
> that people are experts in their own lives. (Interview 22)*

If the consultees are seen as having valuable knowledge to bring to the
discussion, they are more likely to be an active participant in it. They
are therefore more likely to buy-in to the consultation and fully engage
with it, thus increasing the efficacy of the consultation.

### 3.1.2 EP skills and knowledge

The other most common theme related to the psychological knowledge and
skills EPs need to use when engaging in consultation.

#### 3.1.2.1 Knowledge

The most common code across all themes was in relation to the models of
consultation and general psychological knowledge that the interviewees
believed EPs needed to have to facilitate an effective consultation. The
*"use of theory and reference to the evidence base"* (Interview 2) was
identified as an important effective feature of consultation. Commonly
discussed models and frameworks included being solution-focused
(Interview 1), person-centred (Interview 16), trauma and attachment
informed (Interview 13), and using Wagner's model of consultation
(Interview 17) and the COMOIRA model (Interview 25). Other specific
psychological areas included using principles from Narrative Therapy
(Interview 17), an ecosystemic model (Interview 2), social
constructivism (Interview 6), as well as psychologies such as positive
psychology (Interview 9). Some interviewees saw their role as
*"sharing... and disseminating psychological theory"* (Interview 18) and
that consultation "helped [them] really use psychology with [their]
schools" (Interview 11).

The use of a model was often spoken positively as *"[giving] the
consultation a structure"* (Interview 11) and for one interviewee they
were the most important part:

> *...for me, the models of psychology are the number one priority, they
> have to be systemic and interactionist so that all behaviour is seen
> as a function of the person and the situation. So that if a concern is
> being described, we want to be looking at finding out about what was
> happening at the time or when it was happening. (Interview 27)*

#### 3.1.2.2 Presenting problem

Many EPs mentioned specific features within different models. One such
feature was exploring the presenting problem from the problem-analysis
framework [@monsenAccountableModelPractice1998]:

> *...getting an idea of what their main concerns are because when it
> feels very big, it's really the problem feels very big, the issue with
> the child is very messy. There's a lot going on, it can be hard to
> know where to start. So focusing them down is something that I do
> where I'm like 'What's your main concern?'. (Interview 8)*

This code also involved *"further clarification around the
difficulties"* (Interview 11) and a discussion of "What are the
conditions around it" (Interview 12).

#### 3.1.2.3 Treatments

Another code relating to the problem-analysis framework was the
discussion of treatments for the CYP. This involved *"planning
recommendations"* (Interview 2) and using the consultation *"as a space
where we can really drill down into exactly what you mean when you say
'A social skills group'"* (Interview 2) as you can decide what the
intervention is specifically for.

#### 3.1.2.4 Suggesting solutions

Another frequently mentioned model was the Solution-focused model
[@murphySolutionfocusedCounselingSchools1997]. A key part of this model
is suggesting solutions and several interviewees brought this idea up.
These are typically recommendations *"to be done at home and at school"*
(Interview 12) Several EPs stated they were happy to make
recommendations but simultaneously did not want to dominate the
consultation (Interview 11). The importance of taking on board what the
consultees said was also voiced by a few interviewee so that the EP does
not make recommendations that have already been tried (Interview 13).

#### 3.1.2.5 Exception seeking

Another code relating to the Solution-focused model was the discussion
of times when the main difficulty is reduced or absent:

> *...building all those principles of, yes, psychology that we're
> trained with, and we're taught to use: exception seeking (Interview
> 24)*

> *...finding out about other contexts when it was similar and other
> contexts when it was different, so that you're able to hypothesise
> about what's happening (Interview 27)*

#### 3.1.2.6 Reflective

A feature mentioned by almost all participants centred around the
importance of being reflective. This included the use of *"reflective
listening"* (Interview 1) and *"[checking] back in with people...
working with them just to understand, have they progressed on that
journey"* (Interview 16). Many interviewees brought up the importance of
checking with the consultees *"whether we did what we wanted to do, and
if not, what still needs to be done?"* (Interview 21).

The importance of being reflective was not limited to within the
consultation; the structure of consultation itself should also
incorporate reflection:

> *...it might be nice within models that we have with schools, if
> there's a definite agreement that there is follow up or a review, if
> it's not by me, if it's by someone in the school, because that, that,
> kind of, ensures that what's discussed in the consultation is
> actually, you know, implemented and monitored. (Interview 14)*

> *I also like to have a consultation as a feedback meeting at the end
> to... revisit what we've discussed in the first session, and
> obviously, by that time, I'll have gathered information from other
> sources to use that other information to further inform what is going
> to be done about the situation and to answer their referral question.
> (Interview 9)*

This reflective structure extends to the gaining of feedback from
consultees. The importance of feedback was mentioned by several
interviewees, for example: *"we have to treat it as a cyclical process
which has to be reviewed and evaluated so that we can use that feedback
to improve practices"* (Interview 1). Learning from peers through
observation and critical reflection with colleagues was also
highlighted:

> *I would hope that I'm a reflective practitioner and also, erm, having
> other people observe consultation, is really helpful in terms of
> trying to figure out, sometimes, what's going on, what made a
> difference. (Interview 21)*

> *...peer supervision is really helpful in terms of, er, helping your
> practice because obviously, you've got all that shared, sort of, ideas
> and knowledge and bouncing off each other in the team. (Interview 9)*

#### 3.1.2.7 Questioning

The use of question was discussed by more than half the interviewees,
using questions like *"'I wonder what would happen if?' 'What do you
think might happen if?'"* (Interview 25) to explore possibilities and
develop understanding. More banausic questions are asked to explore a
situation to gain a fuller understanding (Interview 5) as well as
exploring the context (Interview 27). However, as the consultation
progresses, questions can be used to get the consultees to think about
what change would look like for the CYP and how they could go about
achieving it (Interview 8). Not only is the content of the questioning
important, but the manner in which they are asked is a key factor *"how
EPs are asking those questions, and the types of questions they're
asking and, erm, the timing of those questions"* (Interview 15).

#### 3.1.2.8 Use of aids

A third of interviewees discussed types of supports that they use in
their consultations. Tools based on person-centred psychology, such as
Planning Alternative Tomorrows with Hope (PATHs) and Making Action Plans
(MAPs), was brought up by Interviewees 16 and 17. The use of metaphors
was endorsed as means to safely explore difficult topics (Interview 12),
as well as *"the Japanese problem-solving fish" and "blob trees"*
(Interview 10).

#### 3.1.2.9 Preparation

A number of interviewees highlighted the importance of being prepared
for a consultation, where the *"psychologist pools all that information,
formulates the hypothesis, types down what questions they want to ask"*
(Interview 20). This increases the chance of the consultation being
effective:

> *I think doing really thoughtful preparation is essential to to
> effective consultation, and I think sometimes there just isn't time
> for that but but really spending some time to think about, you know,
> what, what do we know? What what do I, what am I hoping to get out of
> this?" (Interview 13)*

This preparation, of *"being in the right headspace yourself"*
(Interview 13) extends to the consultees as them not being prepared can
hamper the efficacy of a consultation:

> *I think for a lot of the time, what limits my consultations is,
> they're just, sort of, caug- maybe a teacher is, sort of, caught on
> the cuff, they weren't really expecting me to meet them there, erm,
> but there they are. So they haven't really had time to, sort of,
> gather their thoughts beforehand. (Interview 20)*

#### 3.1.2.10 Reflexive

Another important feature of an effective consultation was the EP being
reflexive. This involves critically analysing, in the moment, *"'How's
my body language affecting the person that I'm speaking with?' 'How did
that question go down?' 'Was it understood?' Am I helping this
person?'"* (Interview 10). This process involves being *"flexible and
responsive"* (Interview 21) and *"adaptable"* (Interview 30) which can
be inhibited by the use of a consultation script (Interview 30). One
interviewee discussed the importance of:

> *...being aware of what's going on in the discussion and what the
> function of the discussion might be for the consultee at any one time.
> For example, if the adult is clearly struggling with the child, they
> might be looking for empathy... and understanding, so very much giving
> that but recognising that that in itself won't necessarily move things
> on. So trying to be aware... of what the function of their use of
> language is at the time and what they're trying to elicit from me.
> (Interview 14)*

Another interviewee discussed the importance of being sensitive to
*"anything that might be... difficult for potentially parents to talk
about"* (Interview 15). This process of being reflexive also helps
prevent the EP *"[imposing] my construct on the situation"* (Interview
25).

#### 3.1.2.11 Summarising

Several EPs mentioned that summarising or paraphrasing (Interview 19)
what has been said in a consultation is an important feature of
consultation. This includes *"re-speaking back to people what they've
told you"* (Interview 17) and *"[giving] a summary of what I think I've
heard from the different people"* (Interview 5).

#### 3.1.2.12 Efficient

The most frequently cited reason for consultation being effective was
that it is an efficient way of practising. This includes the simple fact
that *"more children get to have EP input"* (Interview 11) because it is
possible to *"talk about multiple students and put multiple things in
place as a result of that [consultation]"* (Interview 15). It is a tool
to *"gather information from different sources quickly"* (Interview 2)
which helps *"generate, hopefully accurate as possible, hypotheses"*
(Interview 30). Consultation also can *"effect change at a higher level
and a greater level"* (Interview 12) and there can be a *"ripple
effect... across policy level or across class or a group or even a whole
school"* (Interview 16). This means that "sometimes you might only need
one or *two consultation sessions to make some good change"* (Interview
17).

#### 3.1.2.13 Varied space for approach

Another key mechanism through which consultation is effective is its
versatility. *"Consultation is flexible"* (Interview 21) and a *"process
that evolves all the time"* (Interview 24). They allow for the use of
*"different strategies, different components"* (Interview 10) to meet
the needs of the consultees. Because consultation can be flexible, it
can adapt to a situation and therefore have a greater chance of a
positive impact:

> *I think the logistics of a consultation can remain the same, but the
> impact of a consultation can really vary. And... I don't know how many
> other tools we have available that that's the case for. So, if I think
> about the logistics for doing the BAS, or the logistics for doing a
> CBT session, I think that you very quickly become constrained by the
> way they were set up, whereas, the logistics for a consultation,
> getting some people in a room for a certain amount of time, allows for
> a flexibility. So... sometimes halfway through a consultation, you'll
> discover a piece of information that is crucial and up until now
> completely unknown, and you can change tack. (Interview 2)*

### 3.1.3 Shared understanding

This theme centres around the importance and ways in which EPs create a
common understanding of the situation between themselves and consultees.

#### 3.1.3.1 Different views

Almost every interviewee brought up the importance of gaining the views
of different people and *"gaining multiple perspectives"* (Interview
21). This includes *"the voice of the child, voice of the family, voice
of the teacher"* (Interview 17). It is particularly important to bring
the voice of the CYP: *"being quite child centred... bringing the pupil
voice into that discussion... [as] it's often not appropriate to have
the student in the room, especially if they're younger"* (Interview 15).
A few interviewees talked about the importance of gaining the views and
including those with power in the system:

> *I think in some ways, as well, in consultation, making sure trying to
> involve, at some stage or at some level, people within a school or
> organisation who hold power. So that might be a head or a deputy head.
> Just because they have a lot of power within that system, to reframe.
> (Interview 17)*

> *...we are trying to become more active within the local authority as
> well. And I think that's very important. Because otherwise if you work
> as an EP service in isolation, without connects- strong connections
> with the senior leadership team within the local authority, and with
> the senior leadership team within the schools, nobody's gonna listen.
> (Interview 23)*

Consultation also allows for the *"understanding [of] different worlds
views, different cultural... constructs"* (Interview 17) and one
interviewee stated *"when people start to tell stories of things, it
gives you some quite good insights into how they think and where...
they're stuck in their thinking"* (Interview 12). By gaining different
views from consultees, the EP is better placed to make informed
hypotheses (Interview 20). When there is a disagreement between home and
school, consultation is an effective vehicle to *"bring that...
discrepancy into the room and discuss it and see if we can come up with
it with a kind of compromise or a way forward that... meets the needs of
both parties, and particularly for the student as well"* (Interview 15).

#### 3.1.3.2 Information gather

A related code was the EP gathering information not directly related to
the main concern: *"I find a lot out about the child, their background,
and... about the parents or family and what's going went around them"*
(Interview 8). This included *"[gathering] information from across the
four areas of SEND"* (Interview 2). This helps *"inform [their]
assessment"* (Interview 9). However, a number of interviewees made the
point that consultation is much more than simply gathering information:
*"the word 'consultation' might sometimes be interchangeably used with,
actually, what's really an information gathering process"* (Interview
24).

#### 3.1.3.3 Clarity

Over half the interviewees talked about the importance of gaining
clarity in a variety of ways. This included for *"what the process might
look like"* (Interview 20) as well as *"clarifying what people are
saying, what the parent is saying, what the SENCO is saying, what the
class teacher is saying"* (Interview 4). This done in the service of
*"understanding the situation better and exploring and understanding it
better"* (Interview 5). This allows for the EP to draw these strands
together and *"come to some kind of conceptualisation towards the end"*
(Interview 5).

#### 3.1.3.4 Setting out consultation plan

The establishing, by the EP, of the general structure for the
consultation was cited by more than half the interviewees as an
important feature of consultation. This was often done by exploring with
all those involved *"what we're hoping to get from the meeting, from the
consultation"* (Interview 24) because this *"gives it a clear
direction... [a] frame, [a] boundary"* (Interview 14). It also helps
*"[manages] everyone's expectations"* (Interview 14) and allows those
involved to know if they have achieved what they wanted to achieve
within the consultation (Interview 13).

#### 3.1.3.5 Language

Several interviewees brought up the importance of the language used
within a consultation. This had two main strands: potential language
difficulties due to English as a second language and the use of jargon
by the professional. One of the barriers to effective consultation is
*"lack of English language, from parents. It's not always possible to
have a translator... and even if you do... there are barriers... it's
difficult going through a third person. You have no idea... how
accurately they're translating"* (Interview 5). The other facet related
to the technical language that is pervades psychology and how this is
understood by the consultees:

> *It takes a much higher level of skill to have a meaningful
> consultation with somebody who does not have... the privilege of
> having... lots of education, and... [a] big vocabulary and high level
> of verbal skill, than it does... for us to sit around in a team
> surrounded by people who are educated to doctorate level... But when
> you really need to try and get meaningful information in a respectful
> way from from somebody who finds language very hard, that's... a
> whole... nother level of professional skill. (Interview 3)*

#### 3.1.3.6 Documentation

Documentation refers to the making of notes and summarising the contents
of the consultation. One EP stated it was *"[their] least favourite part
of the job... But unfortunately, it's really important, because I think
you've got an opportunity to write down and, kind of, what they call a
narrative, like rescue the words"* (Interview 17). Another expressed
more uniformly negative views towards documentation: *"what... will make
consultations: not having to flippin' write them up afterwards, we'd get
twice as many done... I don't understand why I'm writing about, the
magic happens in the room"* (Interview 22). However, others were more
positive: *"I think the written record is helpful of a consultation"*
(Interview 5) as it gives another opportunity to give advice at a later
date (Interview 30).

#### 3.1.3.7 EP explaining role

A small number of interviewees stated that making sure the consultees
understand what their role is within the consultation is important:
*"try and clarify what my role is and what it isn't"* (Interview 14).
This included *"[explaining] [their] involvement"* (Interview 14) and,
to help this process, one interviewee talked about *"[doing] role of the
EP insets, which we would offer every year, that talks about
consultation and the model of psychology and what's going to happen in
the meeting"* (Interview 27).

### 3.1.4 Intervention

Another theme which arose was the value of consultation as an
intervention in and of itself. This was done through three mechanisms:
providing a space for the EP to change consultees perceptions;
emotionally supporting consultees, and consultation being part of the
assessment process.

#### 3.1.4.1 Changing perspectives

One of the main ways in which interviewees talked about changing
perspectives was around *"extending the thought processes of the people
involved"* (Interview 10). A common idea among the interviewees was that
the consultation *"facilitates that process of developing new meaning
and new knowledge around a young person, or whatever the issue might
be... reframing the way that people see it, which I think is a key
element of change within consultation"* (Interview 17). The EP should
also help others *"not [think] about a problem within a child, but
[think] about a young person and how they interact with the environment
that they are in"* (Interview 13).

This change can also happen at a policy level, as one interviewee stated
that consultation was the best vehicle to help schools become more
inclusive (Interview 23). Consultation can also be used to help realign
people's priorities and view towards those involved. Because of the
highly pressurised nature of the systems we work in, *"family, and
school can quite often fall out of sync and having a conversation
together reminds everyone, they're on the same team"* (Interview 2).

This perspective change was not limited to the consultees views towards
the CYP or situation; it extended to their views of consultation itself.
One interviewee talked about how for *"[their] schools, once they were
introduced to [consultation], and once they tried it, they really liked
it"* and they could appreciate that *"consultation is a good model"*
(Interview 11)

#### 3.1.4.2 Supporting consultees

Another point many EPs made was that consultations can often be used to
help emotionally contain and provide support for the consultees:
*...there is also something about consultation with schools that I find
that can be emotionally containing for staff who perhaps are highly
distressed (Interview 13)*. These *"therapeutic benefits"* (Interview 2)
in a *"therapeutic style of meeting"* (Interview 22) often come through
high levels of *"acceptance and empathy"* (Interview 13) because often
consultees want to *"communicate with someone... how challenging it is
for them"* (Interview 17). However, this was an area in which a few EPs
judged that tech consultations were less effective as *"not being able
to be physically there, as the sounding board, as their containing
person... I couldn't be that... in a virtual environment"* (Interview
17)

#### 3.1.4.3 Assessment

A few interviewees saw the consultation as *"part of the assessment
process"* (Interview 3) and as a *"powerful way to carry out
assessment"* (Interview 19). This is because consultation can *"[lay]
the foundation for an application for an EHCP assessment"* (Interview
2).

### 3.1.5 Strengths-based

Another emergent theme centred around the focus of consultation: it
being strengths-based as it focuses on bringing out the skills of the
consultees, highlighting what work is already having a positive impact
for the cYP, and discussing the positive qualities of the CYP.

#### 3.1.5.1 Empowering individuals

One of the key features of an effective consultation is *"helping people
to identify their own resources"* (Interview 10) and *"activate better
existing skills and knowledge and competence"* (Interview 13)

#### 3.1.5.2 What's already working

One aspect which was frequently discussed was the exploration of what
was already working for the CYP. Interviewees talked about "[trying] to
build more of a strengths-based and positive outlook, and look at what's
working well, to shift things on" (Interview 22) and "trying to find
what has been tried, what has worked" (Interview 28).

#### 3.1.5.3 CYP strengths

The exploration of the strengths and positive qualities of the CYP was
also mentioned by several interviewees, such as: "it's exploring skills
and competencies alongside the problem" (Interview 27). A common idea
was the consultations help reinvigorate the consultees and using the
skills they already have:

> *"... building on what they potentially knew, but didn't really know
> what to do with it and... empowering and recognising that they were
> potentially able to sort out themselves". (Interview 19)*

> *"... a decent consultation... can help them feel empowered and
> perhaps a little bit reinfused about what their role could be".
> (Interview 13)*

A related idea was the empowering of those the consultees engage with,
as a *"rising tide lifts all boats, in the sense that the person to whom
I can give the consultation will very often generalise the advice from
one case to another, from one session to another, from... one class to
another"* (Interview 7)

### 3.1.6 Future facing

The final theme of the super code Internal factors focused on the idea
of the consultation as helping to give a path forward for the
consultees. This included the creation of goals for the CYP and the
nature of consultation helping to prevent problems for other CYP in the
future.

#### 3.1.6.1 Way forward

Over a third of the interviewees talked about how the nature of an
effective consultation gives consultees a structure for how to move
forward in supporting the CYP: *"it provides a mechanism to think about
the future and to move forwards"* (Interview 15). Through consultation,
the EP can *"elicit change or move people forward in a positive way"*
(Interview 22) as well as identify the relevant support for the CYP
(Interview 5). This is different from identifying specific goals for the
CYP as consultations aren't *"always about solution finding because ways
forwards aren't always solutions"* (Interview 3).

#### 3.1.6.2 Goal setting

For almost a third of interviewees, the identification of precise
outcomes for the CYP to work towards is an important feature of
consultation:

> *"... for it to be consultation, I think there needs to be a clear,
> focus on finding, even if it's not a solution, but on coming up with a
> plan and... having a clear goal in mind". (Interview 11)*

> *"... [a] key component is goal setting, actually, and thinking about
> futures, and what the next steps would be". (Interview 17)*

However, one interviewee argued that not identifying clear goals does
not *"necessarily make it an ineffective consultation"* (Interview 3).

#### 3.1.6.3 Preventative

Because of the emphasis on upskilling consultees within consultations,
an EP using consultation can help prevent issues arising with other CYP
within the school:

> *"when you're working with a teacher or with families or with
> different staff, actually the learning might be, the focus might be
> around a specific child, but actually that learning and that reframing
> can then be taken and be used preventatively with other young people
> or in the classroom" (Interview 17)*

By using consultations in different ways, such as regular features of
school life, *"they would become more preventative"* (Interview 14).

#### 3.1.6.4 Ideas for future EP work

A few interviewees brought up the importance of using consultations to
talk about and negotiate future EP involvement with the CYP (Interview
24). This might include an observation of the CYP in class (Interview
4).

### 3.1.7 Conditions

The first theme of the super code External factors related to the
conditions of the consultations, including who was involved, how much
time was set aside for the consultation, and the space in which it was
held.

#### 3.1.7.1 Key people

Almost every interviewee cited having *"all the key stakeholders"*
(Interview 11) involved in the consultation as a key aspect.
Consultation was widely regarded as an *"indirect service method"*
(Interview 17) so involved working with a range of people, including
*"the SENCO, the class teacher, and both the mum and dad of that child"*
(Interview 11). Many interviewees state that it was crucial to have
*"the person that has most knowledge about the child"* (Interview 10) or
the *"people who are most concerned"* (Interview 21). This included the
person who *"has the most influence"* (Interview 14) as they will be the
person who will implement the agreed interventions.

A number of interviewees highlighted the importance of bringing the
voice of the CYP into the consultation, either by actively involving
them in the consultation (Interview 21) or through those that know the
CYP well (Interview 15).

Many interviewees identified difficulties with conducting consultations
in secondary schools:

> *...if you've got multiple people working with a young person, and
> actually the more people you have, the less anybody feels any
> responsibility for them... you're trying to find that person who is
> most concerned and actually they don't exist. (Interview 13)*

> *...it's very difficult to get parents, teachers, parents and teachers
> around the same table, at the same time. (Interview 18)*

#### 3.1.7.2 Time

Over two thirds of the interviewees brought up time as an important part
of a consultation. This mainly took the form of interviewees stating
that the biggest barrier to effective consultations was a lack of time
within the consultation, for example: *"I don't think you can have, say
an, effective 20 minute consultation. It's not a consultation"*
(Interview 26). This is because you need time for those involved to move
beyond the "black and white way of thinking" about labels (Interview
18).

A related issue centred around the amount of time bought in by schools.
Because the majority of interviewees either worked for fully traded
services or as private EPs, the schools they worked with only had a
limited amount of contact time. This led to several interviewees
discussing the difficulty of bringing about change with schools because
of the time limits placed on them (Interview 12).

This was an area where tech consultations provided an advantage, as EPs
can save time by not travelling between different schools (Interviews
13, 17, & 29).

#### 3.1.7.3 Resources

Resources was often cited important feature to consultations. This had
several dimensions, including the ability of the consultees to enact
change for the CYP due to resource constraints:

> *The biggest barrier I come across is people saying, 'Well, that's
> lovely and I think we've come up with some fabulous ideas. However, I
> don't think management will let me do that'... So top down
> squashing... it's budgetary, it's time-bound, it's people saying,
> 'Well, we don't have the physical resources to be able to do that'.
> (Interview 16)*

> *... we might have all the ideas in the world around how someone might
> be supported. And it doesn't, I guess, affect the consultation in
> itself so much but it affects, it does affect the type of dialogue we
> might have around, schools and just the lack in, the workforce, the
> lack in staff, they're lacking the resourcing to really support some
> of these young people in the way that we would like them to be. I
> think that shapes consultations. (Interview 17)*

Another dimension is the resources school have to allow staff the time
off from lessons to fully engage with a consultation: *"schools thinking
'We don't have the time and the capacity to free up staff to come and,
come and sit and have a consultation'"* (Interview 15).

A third dimension related to the resources available to the schools to
buy in EP time:

> *... I've certainly got schools that repeatedly say to me that they
> would love more EP time but they can't afford it in a traded
> environment and lots of... competing things that they have to spend
> money on. (Interview 21)*

#### 3.1.7.4 Space

A number of interviewees identified the importance of creating a space
for effective consultations to occur. This encompassed both the physical
space of the location and the mental space to be able to deal with
complex experiences:

> *... sometimes people have asked to do consultations in rooms where
> there are other people and it's just messy. (Interview 2)*

> *I think the room that you meet in is quite important and the way that
> it's set up... so... it doesn't seem like an interview situation.
> (Interview 9)*

This aspect is particularly important for tech consultations as these
almost always occur in the EP's and consultee's home:

> *... it can be difficult for staff to really, and parents, to really
> engage with the process, if they've got children running around and
> things going on. So... doing it where they can't have a separate
> space, emotionally as well as physically, can be tricky. (Interview
> 14)*

> *... having to make sure that doors are secure, so children can't run
> in at particular points. (Interview 24)*

#### 3.1.7.5 Confidential

Several interviewees brought up the importance of confidentiality for
what was discussed in the consultation: *"we want to have a confidential
place to reflect"* (Interview 22). This helps *"contribute towards
building that kind of environment where people feel happy to share"*
(Interview 15). The importance of confidentiality was made more
important for many interviewees by the unexpected transition to tech
consultations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with several
identifying issues around security, for example: "the first step is
finding an effective platform that's got enough safety features for us
to be able to... carry out a consultation" (Interview 10).

### 3.1.8 Context

The second code within the External factors overarching theme was
related to the general context that consultations are conducted within.

#### 3.1.8.1 Education systems

EPs work within many systems. These can all impact on individual
consultations and on how EPs work through consultation. For example,
*"there are schools who don't particularly value [consultation] and just
want us to do assessments"* (Interview 5). As one interviewee stated,
*"all the work of the EPs is determined by the context in which it's set
and by the organisational agendas in which it's set"* (Interview 10).
Several interviewees talked about the bureaucracy of the education
system impacting on consultations and EP work as a whole:

> *...[the] role of the EP is less problem solving, it's more ticking a
> box, more bureaucratic exercise rather than a solving facilitation.
> (Interview 10)*

> *...there is a bureaucracy around an education, health care plan, in
> terms of certain reports being written, certain hurdles being gone
> through and certain assessments taking place. And so... we're not
> doing any thinking, we're merely following a bureaucratic process.
> (Interview 6)*

Other wider systemic issues related to how society as a whole sees
additional needs:

> *...the medical model is so predominant... And I often find that those
> explanations for, learning and development and behaviours, can
> dominate conversations... ADHD, ASD... they are definitely a barrier
> to creating more effective, positive change. (Interview 17)*

> *...there's enormous pressure, ever increasing pressure on schools, to
> get results. And... [that's] antithetical to consultation. (Interview
> 25)*

A number of EPs identified operating in traded services as a barrier to
consultation:

> *...I feel like it's the situation in which we work, the whole traded
> model, which means that consultation is, an addition... we just have
> to do it to get the information. It's not... valued as... a way of
> working in and of itself. (Interview 8)*

> *...I find within a traded service, you're quite constricted, in lots
> of ways about what the school expect in terms of the use of your time.
> (Interview 9)*

> *...I feel like... particularly in the traded service model, that
> dynamic is really hard to manage. And... it's been a real difficulty
> to introduce consultation as a working modelling in many of my
> schools. (Interview 11)*

Another issue that was identified was the views that school staff had
towards change because of the people with more power in the system:
*"SENCOs feeling unable to make change because of the head teacher"*
(Interview 23).

#### 3.1.8.2 Individual differences

Almost five sixths of the interviewees brought up the characteristics of
those involved in the consultation as an important feature of a
consultation. The personalities, histories, and on the day mood of the
consultees will likely impact on a consultation:

> *... that's going to play out in the room, in different ways,
> depending on the circumstances, the resilience of individuals,
> position, their own history, etc, etc. And will play out differently
> day to day, with the same people. (Interview 25)*

> *... there are parents who just don't like coming into school, are
> barred from school... have such a difficult relationship with school
> that is not possible. Physically can't get there because of health
> issues or younger children. (Interview 5)*

> *I think there's always going to be a level of... personality
> involved, that with some people, it is easier to... get that...
> feeling of engagement higher than it is with others... I think there
> is some variability, just because of human nature and the different
> personalities of the people that you meet. (Interview 12)*

The personality of the EP was identified by a few interviewees as
potentially impacting on a consultation, for example: *"I think the
personality of the individual EP can have a big impact"* (Interview 24).
EP confidence in their own skill and knowledge was also identified as an
important feature (Interview 14).

This variability in the presentation of consultation was viewed as a
potential negative for consultation; if a teacher or parent was told
they had to attend a consultation they *"wouldn't know what to expect
because it would depend so much on the individual"* (Interview 11)
because *"everybody has gone on their own and done totally different
things"* (Interview 23).

#### 3.1.8.3 Understanding of SEN

A few interviewees stated that the way a school understands additional
needs within an education context can have an impact on consultations.
Some schools cleave to a more traditional 'within-child' understanding
of additional needs, particularly secondary schools (Interview 14). As
such, it is much harder to encourage these schools to adopt consultation
as a way of working (Interview 11).

#### 3.1.8.4 EP workload

Almost a third of interviewees identified the amount of work EPs
typically do as being a barrier to effective consultations. This was
because the volume of work prohibits being able to fully engage with a
case:

> *... when you are on the day job, and you are 24-7 doing EP stuff, and
> you have... a stupid amount of cases and a stupid amount of schools
> and you cannot think... you are running on... empty (Interview 23)*

> *... you're so tired and stressed... you're not really thinking as
> well... you can't reflect on it and come up with different ideas and
> solutions because... you just have to get that written, get it sent
> off, and get on to the next thing. (Interview 9)*

One interviewee identified the positive benefit of moving to tech
consultations because *"I have a lot more time in my day, which means
that I actually have a lot more space to think about children and
cases"* (Interview 18).

#### 3.1.8.5 School knowledge

A few interviewees stated that having *"in depth knowledge of schools
and how they work"* (Interview 7), in particular secondary schools
(Interview 22), helped their consultations be more effective. One
interviewee explained that having good knowledge of the whole system
differentiated EPs from clinical psychologists because EPs are
"fluent... in that... understanding and situational context" (Interview
21).

#### 3.1.8.6 Outside system

Almost a third of interviewees stated that the EP working outside the
school system helped their consultations be more effective:

> *I think being an external person helps... you are able to ask some of
> the questions of parents that school can't, you can also ask questions
> of school that parents [can't] and take on that more challenging
> aspects. (Interview 5)*

> *... we have to get meta to the situation and not get too bogged down
> and immersed in the nitty gritty. So keeping meta and keeping
> perspective on it, I think is a skill that EPs can bring, that really
> helps. And that's the beauty of not working in the system, is the
> beauty of going in and out of schools. (Interview 27)*

POTENTIALLY USE ELSEWHERE The EP is gathering and summarising the ideas
and saying, 'Given what we've discussed, and the ideas we've heard so
far, what is going to make most sense for this young person and what's
going to make most difference'? And then it's getting the ideas from the
people. (Interview 27)

Collaboration was identified as a key factor not only because it
increased the consultee's willingness to engage but because it increased
the chances of the recommendations being put in place:

I think if you have a really good consultation and you can actually
problem solve together, and the people that you're consulting with,
actually come up with some of the ideas, then it's much more likely for
those interventions to happen. (Interview 20)

it underpins all of the work that we do with schools. So I would say
every school visit, team meetings, organisational level consultations,
we would be applying the same psychologies, the same frameworks.
(Interview 27)

## 3.2 Observations

The quantitative half of the research involved the observing of 6
consultations with the features identified by the researcher. 10 goals
were agreed across the consultations. Progress towards agreed goals were
then calculated through TME forms and the relationship between the
observation of features and progess was calculated using QCA.

### 3.2.1 Features

Table 1 summarises the cumulative frequencies of each feature for each
consultation. The most frequently observed feature was Understanding the
presenting problem, followed by CYP strengths, and then Info gather. 3
features were observed on zero occasions (School knowledge, EP
explaining role, and Planning/implementing treatments). Understanding
the presenting problem was observed the most frequently in every
consultation, often twice as frequently as the next most observed
feature. CYP strengths was the next most frequently observed, followed
by Information gather.

### 3.2.2 Qualitative description of consultations

The first consultation was a joint home-school consultation with the
child's teacher and parent. Both consultees were receptive from the
beginning and engaged with the consultation. For the final 10 minutes,
the parent had to leave to go and pick up another child. Whilst they
were present in the consultation, their attention was diverted as they
were driving. It was during this time that the goals for their child
were agreed.

The second consultation was a teacher consultation for child 2. The
teacher was engaged from the start of the consultation but was very
stressed due to overwork and stated this during the consultation. When
the topic of identifying goals for the child was brought up, they
started crying. This was because of the perceived pressure of another
metric (which they believed would show no progress for the child) and
they had to be emotionally contained by the EP. After being supported,
they were able to identify one goal for the child.

The next consultation was for the parent of child 2. They were attentive
during the consultation and fully engaged for its entirety. With support
from the EP, they identified three goals for their child.

The consultation for child 3 was a parent consultation. They gave their
full attention to the consultation and was joined by their partner for
the final 20 minutes, who also fully engaged. The parent identified one
goal for their child.

The first consultation for child 4 was with the child's teacher. In this
consultation, the EP used the Cognitive Abilities Profile
[@deutschCognitiveAbilitiesProfile2009]. This is a framework based on
Dynamic Assessment [@feuersteinLearningPotentialAssessment1995] which
seeks to explore "identify patterns of cognitive strengths and
difficulties and then jointly plan, intervene and systematically monitor
progress" [@deutschCognitiveAbilitiesProfile2021]. The consultee was
engaged throughout and at the conclusion of the consultation identified
one goal for the child.

The second consultation for child 4 involved the child's parents. They
gave their full attention, although one expressed frustration at having
at repeatedly explain their child's needs to different professionals.
They identified one goal for their child.

### 3.2.3 TME data

Ten goals were identified for the four CYP. Table 2 summarises the goals
for each child and with whom the goals were created by. It also shows
what baseline rating was given, the expected value 6-8 weeks later, the
actual rating, and the corresponding progress for the CYP. Appendix J
presents all TME ratings in a line graph
[@wickhamGgplot2ElegantGraphics2016]. There was one unit of reported
change for six of the ten goals. One goal (from the parent of child 2)
was judged to have made two units of progress since the baseline rating.
Regarding the three goals which were judged to have not made progress,
two were given by the parents of the children and one by the teacher.

In relation to goals between consultees for the same child, there was no
consistency. Two goals were shared across both teacher and parent (child
1 and child 2). For child 1, the teacher stated they had progressed from
a '3' to a '4' regarding their ability to accept play requests from
other children. The parent of child 1 did not believe they had made
progress over the 8 weeks, though they agreed with the baseline and
expected rating. For child 2, the teacher judged they had not made
progress regarding their ability to name their emotions without pausing
for an extended period of time (remaining at '3'). The parent stated
that child 2 was at a '5' at baseline and had progressed to a '6' eight
weeks later.

#### 3.2.3.1 Child 1

The joint home-school consultation for child 1 identified two goals,
with one being judged by both parent and teacher and one by only the
teacher[^1]. Child 1 was judged to be at a '3' for the baseline for all
their goals. The expected change for the goals was two or three points
greater. The actual progress after 8 weeks was judged by their teacher
as being one for both goals. Their parent judged they had not made any
progress on the identified goal.

[^1]: The parent did not judge the second goal because they stated they
    did not understand what the goal meant.

#### 3.2.3.2 Child 2

For child 2, there was a teacher consultation followed by a parent
consultation. Their teacher identified one goal and rated them currently
at a '3' and expected to rate them as a '7' in 6-8 weeks time. 8 weeks
later, their teacher rated that no progress had been made. Their parent
identified three goals for them. They rated the baseline for two of the
goals as '5' (one of which was the shared goal with the teacher) and one
of them as '3'. They expected to rate their child as '8' in 6-8 weeks
time for the goals with the baseline of '5' and at '5' for the goal with
a baseline of '3'. The actual progress was one for the shared goal, two
for the second goal with a baseline of '5' and one for the goal with a
baseline of '3'.

#### 3.2.3.3 Child 3

Child 3 had only a parent consultation and one goal identified. They
were given a baseline of '3' and were expected to be rated at a '4'. 8
weeks later, the actual rating was a '3', showing no progress.

#### 3.2.3.4 Child 4

Child 4 had a teacher consultation and a parent consultation. One goal
was identified for each, although they were different. The teacher gave
the child a baseline of '2' and an expected rating of '4'. 8 weeks
later, they rated child 4 as a '3', thus showing a change of one. The
parents gave a rating of '3' for a distinct goal (emotion regulation)
and an expected value of '5'. The actual rating given was '4', also
showing a change of one.

### 3.2.4 QCA

To gain a deeper understanding of which combination of conditions lead
to change, crisp-set QCA was performed for each goal. Therefore, the
results from consultations with more than one goal were duplicated to
allow analysis for the individual goals. The first step of QCA
necessitated the flattening of the data so the features and change were
either classed as 'present' or 'absent', The mean was used as the
threshold as there was no theoretically justified threshold. Features
which were not observed once were removed.

#### 3.2.4.1 Calibration

Table 3 shows the calibrated table of features. After calibration, EP
using expert knowledge was the most frequently occurring feature.
Suggesting solutions and Information gather were the next most commonly
observed features. For the parent consultation of child 2, because the
number of times each feature was seen was below the mean, no features
were classed as present. However, change was judged to have occurred for
each goal. For the other goals which recorded change, three contained EP
using expert knowledge, Suggesting solutions, and Information gather.
Two contained Empowering individuals, Setting out the consultation plan,
Everyone's contributions valued, and CYP strengths.

#### 3.2.4.2 Truth table and Boolean minimisation

To further reduce the complexity of the data, the calibrated table was
converted into a truth table where cases with either identical
conditions or cases with one condition different were collapsed. This
produced Table 4. Table 4 shows the combination of different conditions,
whether change was observed or not (Outcome), the number of cases which
this combination corresponds to (n), the sufficiency inclusion score
(incl), and the cases which are included within this combination
(cases). There were no contradictory combinations. The sufficiency
inclusion score of 1 indicates that this combination of features is
necessary and sufficient for change. The score of 0.66 suggests this
combination is not as strongly necessary or sufficient for change (as
only two of the three cases or 66% saw change).

Boolean minimisation was then performed on the truth table to
demonstrate the simplest combination of conditions which were sufficient
for change to be observed. This led to three combinations (see Appendix
K for breakdown of the combinations and the cases they correspond to).
For example, one combination of features which was sufficient and
necessary for change was the absence of Empowering individuals, the
absence of Ideas for future EP work, the presence of Setting out the
consultation plan, the absence of the EP using expert knowledge, the
presence of Understanding the presenting problem, the absence of
Everyone' contributions valued, the presence of Discussing what already
works, the absence of CYP strengths, the absence of Suggesting
solutions, and the presence of Information gathering. This corresponded
to the teacher consultation for child 4.

# 4 Discussion

This chapter explores the findings from this piece of research with
regards to the research questions, with links to the extant literature.
The aim of this study was to gain insight into the core features of an
effective consultation. This was done through interviews and
observations of real-world consultations (combined with statistical
analysis of theoretically derived features). To evaluate this aim, the
RQs in relation to the results were explored, followed by a critical
analysis of the research. Implications for the EP field are discussed
and suggestions for future work informed by this research are provided.
Researcher reflections on the process and conclusions are also detailed.

## 4.1 Discussion of findings

This section identifies the RQs and details the relevant strands of the
results to allow analysis of them. Due to the large wealth of data, it
is not within the scope of this thesis to provide exhaustive analysis of
each code. Given this, key codes and ideas will be drawn out and
analysed.

### 4.1.1 What are the core features of an effective consultation?

To answer this RQ, it was divided into three sub-RQs which allowed
analysis of this question in finer detail. This was done through
interviews and the explicit views of EPs.

#### 4.1.1.1 What do EPs believe are the key features of an effective consultation?

The 8 themes regarding the core features of consultation encapsulate a
very broad range of aspects of consultation that a number of EPs (of
varying levels of experience) believe are important for making
consultation effective. The most frequently identified themes were
Buy-in and EP skills and knowledge. There was a large disparity between
the number of inductive and deductive codes. There was also a difference
between the number of instances for each type of code, with the
inductive codes being recorded more frequently than deductive codes.
This suggests that the current literature does not accurately reflect
EPs beliefs about effective consultation.

##### 4.1.1.1.1 Buy-in

Buy-in referred to all the participants of the consultation, including
the EP, believing that consultation is an effective method for enacting
change for the CYP in question. Believing that this was a valuable use
of their time and that it could help the CYP was believed by many
interviewees to be essential for an effective consultation. Without this
buy-in, consultees would not be willing to engage with the process or
change anything as a result of the consultation. And if nothing changed,
it is unlikely the situation would improve for the CYP and it is even
less likely the EP could have a positive impact through consultation
[@noellResearchExaminingRelationships2014].

This buy-in could be established at two time points: prior to the
consultation and during the consultation. Before the consultation, the
consultees view of consultation had a large impact on whether they
valued the process. If they understood what it was (via explanation or
training) and believed that it could help, then the chances of the
consultation having a positive impact improved. If they understood that
they were an active member of the consultation and did not look to the
EP as the expert who would fix the problem for them, then they could
buy-in to the process and an effective consultation was more likely to
occur. @hasselbuschWorkingTogetherOccupational2008 found that
consultants being perceived as the expert was felt to have a limiting
impact on the efficacy of the consultation and many participants shared
this view. Buy-in was also facilitated by the EP not viewing themselves
as the expert who was there to tell the consultees what they needed to
do to solve the problem. Thus, prior to the consultation, buy-in for
both the consultees and EP could be established through these
mechanisms.

During the consultation, buy-in by those involved could be facilitated
by the EP. By being collaborative and actively involving the consultees
in the consultation, the EP could encourage their buy-in to the process.
By giving the consultees the opportunity to voice their opinions and
concerns and listening to them, this helped the consultees feel valued
and an active participant in the process
[@bennAnalysisInstructionalConsultants2008]. Consultee voice has been
identified as crucial for effective consultation
[@newmanQualitativeMetasynthesisConsultation2017] and these results
further substantiate this idea. These all served to help create a
rapport between the EP and consultees. This relationship was one of the
most important features of an effective consultation, as without a
trusting relationship between consultees and the EP, consultation cannot
be an effective vehicle for change [@meyersQualitativeMixedMethods2014].
Rapport also formed the foundation for many of the ways consultation
helped consultees, such as through changing consultee perspectives. This
buy-in also greatly increases the chance of solutions being implemented,
which is one of the main mechanisms through which consultation creates
positive change [@meyersQualitativeMixedMethods2014].

##### 4.1.1.1.2 EP skills and knowledge

This theme related to all the ways that EPs use the knowledge gained
over the course of their training and professional practice. It has been
argued that "[possessing] expert knowledge and skills in the field of
educational psychology theory and practice is one of, if not the, most
important requirement for effective consultation
[@farrellReflectionsRoleConsultation2015]. This is reflected in the
results, as every interviewee mentioned at least one example of expert
knowledge they used in their practice. In addition, many explicitly
talked about the importance of this knowledge for effective
consultation.

Specific examples of this knowledge included core models of
consultation, such as Patsy Wagner's model of consultation, as well as
Jey Monsen's Problem-analysis framework.
@meyersQualitativeMixedMethods2014 argue that effective consultation
requires steps such as "problem definition" and other core parts of the
Monsen framework. Many interviewees cited the Problem-analysis framework
as their primary model and a core part of an effective consultation.
However, few interviewees stated they strictly held to any one model.
Many stated they used different elements from different models as and
when appropriate. This paints a picture of consultation, as used by EPs,
as an assortment of different skills and knowledge rather than strict
adherence to one method. To date, there has been no examination of the
efficacy between consultations when there is strict adherence to the
model versus a more eclectic mix. It is therefore unknown whether this
approach to consultation is as effective as strictly using a
consultation model.

Ideas from Solution-focused therapy were frequently mentioned, including
specific components such as the miracle question and looking for
exceptions. Other examples included using person-centred processes
Narrative therapy. This was the only code to be cited by every EP, yet
seems to run counter to the often presented argument "I am not the
expert". This may represent an epistemic conflict between EPs desire to
not be placed in a position of power for fear of undermining consultee
engagement, but also recognising the need to have expert knowledge to be
able to lead an effective consultation. One of the reasons it was
believed to be essential for effective consultation was because many
believed it formed the bedrock of how the EP leads a consultation. This
knowledge also helps provide a structure for the consultation, thus
making it more effective [@wagnerConsultationFrameworkPractice2008].
This is because a structure can help keep the consultation focused on a
single concern which can be tackled
[newmanQualitativeMetasynthesisConsultation2017].

The ability to ask difficult questions and to know what questions to ask
to move a situation forward were frequently given as a key feature of
effective consultation. These questions, developed through training and
experience, help identify the presenting problem and limits to this, as
well as areas where they need more information
[@hylanderEstablishingPsychologicalConsultation2017]. By thoroughly
preparing for the consultation, for example having questions prepared in
advance, the efficacy of it can be increased. This is because it is
easier to know what questions to ask and to keep to the structure.
However, as some interviewees argued, keeping to the structure should
not come at the expense of listening to the concerns of the consultees
and being flexible to their needs. Without this, consultees risk feeling
devalued and thus disengaging
[@slonski-fowlerGeneralEducationTeachers2004]. This presents another
difficulty for EPs who wish to use consultation effectively. Whilst this
psychological knowledge is viewed as essential for effective
consultation, it can undermine this method by being too rigid.

Being a reflective practitioner is often cited in the literature as a
core component of being an EP, for example
@sanderSchoolBasedConsultationTraining2016, and many interviewees stated
the importance of this feature. This reflectivity included personal
reflection on one's own practice to aid professional development but
also the seeking of feedback from the consultees. By engaging in these
practices, interviewees believed your consultations were more likely to
be effective and help the consultees and the CYP move forward. This
critical analysis was not limited to after the consultation; being
reflexive and critically analysing what one was doing in the
consultation and how it was being received was believed to be an
important feature of consultation. This reflects many articles
advocating for the importance of reflexivity when working in education
contexts [@brunoEvaluatingReflexivePractices2011]. However, this in the
moment reflection was mentioned far fewer times than reflective and by
almost a third of the number of interviewees who talked about
reflection.

##### 4.1.1.1.3 Intervention

One of the main mechanisms by which consultation could impact on the
consultees (and by extension the CYP) is through changing the
perspectives of the consultees. This can be towards the situation, the
CYP, or consultation itself. Engendering more positive views of the CYP
has been cited as a key feature of consultation
[@masseImpactSchoolConsulting2013] and almost all interviewees
highlighted the importance of this active component of effective
consultation.

Providing emotional or therapeutic support to the consultees has been
identified as another key part of effective consultation
[@newmanQualitativeMetasynthesisConsultation2017]. When consultees are
highly distressed or anxious, they are unlikely to be able to engage in
consultation. Thus, emotionally containing them and bringing them to an
emotional space where they are able to engage with the process of
consultation is important.
@atkinsonEducationalPsychologistsTherapeutic2011 found that EPs often
use therapeutic interventions with consultation. However, as a few
interviewees identified, often this emotional containment requires time.
It is difficult to fully provide this support in a single consultation.
As such, one-off consultations with consultees may be less effective
because of the emotional needs of the consultees. To engage with the
consultation, they need therapeutic support. But often there is not time
to fully provide this. The EP must therefore make a decision: to
prematurely move the discussion to discussion of potential solutions or
forego said discussion in favour of emotionally supporting the
consultees. Making such a decision would be very difficult and could
undermine the efficacy of a consultation if made wrong.

##### 4.1.1.1.4 Context

Having an understanding of the school is often cited in the literature
as being an important part of consultation, for example: "If consultants
are not internal to the organization, it is critical that they obtain
insider knowledge" [@knotekUtilizingCulturallyResponsive2012]. But very
few interviewees stated such knowledge was important for effective
consultation. This could reflect the interviewee's perception that
knowledge about the school system isn't a feature of consultation but is
a prerequisite for consultation or an example of background knowledge,
rather than an explicit feature. However, it reveals another disparity
between how EPs view consultation and the academic literature.

Another disparity relates to the emphasis placed on the impact of the
individual personalities of the people who engage in consultation.
Almost all interviewees made some comment regarding the importance of
the types of people who take part and how this can impact the efficacy
of consultation. However, this is a rarely discussed aspect of
consultation in the literature. This may reflect the pragmatic stance
EPs take when reflecting on their own practice and how the personality
of their consultees or colleagues impacts a consultation. It may also
reflect the more theoretical or idealised approach various academic
studies approach the issue.

##### 4.1.1.1.5 Strengths-based

Empowering consultees: increasing professional self-efficacy
[@knotekConsultationNewTeacher2002]

A small number of interviewees discussed the importance of highlighting
the strengths of the CYP. This may be because this aspect of
Solution-focused approaches is assumed to be present when interviewees
talk about being Solution-focused in their consultations (18
interviewees mentioned this model explicitly). But without

##### 4.1.1.1.6 Shared understanding

The establishing of the general plan for the consultation is frequently
given as a crucial first step in an effective consultation
[@meyersContractNegotiationStage2002]. This is to manage expectations
and establish a purpose for the consultation. This was a sentiment
shared by just over half the interviewees who cited purposes including
negotiating the purpose of the consultation and using questions to
establish what consultees hope to achieve.

Different views

"being able to identify the unique perspective of those with whom a
consultant is working are essential elements of building rapport and
relationships" [@sanderSchoolBasedConsultationTraining2016]

#### 4.1.1.2 What do EPs believe are the barriers to effective consultation?

The barriers to effective consultation were examined because through the
exploration of factors which undermine the efficacy of consultation, it
will reveal what is needed for an effective consultation to occur. Two
of the biggest barriers brought up by interviewees were not having the
key people involved or not having sufficient time. For a consultation to
be effective, the people who are in a position to change things need to
be involved. If they are not, they are unlikely to buy-in to the
proposed change and make sure it happens. The efficacy of the
consultation is also reduced if you are trying to elucidate a situation
and someone who knows the CYP is not present. Therefore, having the key
people as part of the consultation is essential for it to reach its full
potential of providing clarity and changing the situation (through
perspective change and identifying support strategies).

Time constraints was identified as one of the main barriers to effective
consultation. Therefore, an effective consultation needs time. The
minimum time limit for an effective consultation was judged to be 30
minutes, although most interviewees preferred to have 45 minutes to one
hour. This meant that the consultees did not feel rushed through the
process, which undermines the efficacy of consultation
[@websterMediationConsulteeConceptual2003]. Having time also ensures
that consultees could be properly supported emotionally before exploring
solutions. Time has also been found to be essential for consultee
empowerment and learning [@truscottProfessionalDevelopmentModel2004]. A
lack of time has also been found to decrease the consultee's sense of
ownership for the solutions [@babinskiSupportingNewTeachers1998], which
is one of the main mechanisms through which the features of consultation
are effective (see section 4.1.1.3).

A perennial barrier to effective consultation is a lack of resources
from the school. If the school do not have the resources to implement
any of the devised solutions, it is unlikely the situation will improve
for the CYP. This lack of resources may also affect the consultees as
they feel disempowered even before they have entered the consultation.
They are therefore less likely to buy-in to the process of actively
seeking change and taking ownership of the situation, because they feel
like forces beyond their control are stopping them.

Another barrier related to the schools is the general effect of wider
education systems, such as operating within the traded model or the EHCP
process. Almost all interviewees made reference to the impact education
systems can have on effective consultation. The way a school works was
cited as a significant potential barrier for effective consultation.
Because schools buy EP time, they may believe they have greater control
over the nature of the work they are commissioning as customers
[@leeExplorationDevelopingRole2017]. This arguably constitutes a form of
school knowledge, as an awareness of the schools values and how it
understands EP work impacts on the efficacy of consultation. If a school
does not value consultation then they are less likely to provide
resources for interventions or cover teachers' lessons so they can
attend a consultation. These all undermine the efficacy of consultation.
This idea relates to the importance of trying to include those with
power in the consultation. If this can be done, or at least the
consultees know that those with power see consultation in and of itself
as worthwhile, then consultation is more likely to be effective as
interventions are more likely to be put in place.

Seven interviewees made comments about the amount of work they have to
do and how this negatively affects their consultations. The sheer volume
of work means they felt they did not have the mental space to be able to
fully engage in a given consultation because of stress and feelings of
being overworked. This workload also prohibited them from being able to
fully prepare for consultations, such as reading the case file prior to
the consultation. This was felt to be a significant barrier to the
efficacy of consultation. Previous research has identified the shift to
traded services as being a significant factor in the increase of EP work
load [@islamInvestigationEducationalPsychologists2013].

#### 4.1.1.3 What do EPs believe makes those features effective?

The most frequently discussed reason that the identified features help
ensure consultation is effective is that it is efficient. This took a
few forms, such as being efficient for seeing more children in a short
space of time (as opposed to direct work with children). Many of the
benefits reflect some of the pressures interviewees felt. Several EPs
discussed the need to use consultation because schools could not buy in
more time but wanted psychological input for a large number of children.
They may have also perceived a need to demonstrate their value for money
within a traded context [@leeExplorationDevelopingRole2017] and so
emphasised the cost-efficient nature of consultation. However,
consultation was also efficient because of its ability to have an impact
wider than the consultation itself. Through empowering consultees,
changing perspectives, and emotionally supporting consultees,
consultation can have positive effects for consultees, CYP, and schools
as a whole if they change policy as a result of an effective
consultation.

The key reason identified for making such features as Collaborative, EP
encouraging engagement, and Rapport was the fact it engendered Consultee
ownership of the situation. By making the consultation Collaborative, by
Empowering consultees, those involved feel better equipped to support
the CYP and more motivated to implement recommendations
[@erchulSchoolConsultationConceptual2012].

Another reason identified for making features related to EP knowledge
and skills effective is the fact consultation presents a varied space
for approach. By allowing a wide range of practices and skills to be
used, consultation can be highly flexible to the needs of the consultees
and CYP and thus be best suited to facilitate change. However, the fact
consultation is a platform to allow various psychological tools and
models to be used can be detrimental to EPs and consultees. Given the
potential differences in practice, a consultee without prior experience
is very unlikely to know what to expect prior to a given consultation.
This undermines their ability to buy-in to the process and thus
threatens one of the key mechanisms of effective consultation.

A number of interviewees talked about the importance of being external
to the school system. This being outside the school system meant that
questions could be asked that otherwise could not be and an external
perspective could be brought in
[@cordingStudyEducationalPsychologists2011]. This is particularly
valuable for when a situation feels "stuck" and consultees feel
powerless. By being external, they may be able to see what is already
working and give new recommendations for supporting the CYP.

The giving of recommendations links to another mechanism through which
these features of consultation are effective: that what is recommended
is realistic. By listening to the consultees and valuing their opinions,
EPs are more likely to be able to make recommendations that fit within
the context of the school and can be reasonably put in. If an EP makes a
series of grand recommendations for the CYP but the school do not have
the means to implement them, then there is little chance the situation
will improve. But by having a collaborative consultation, in which
recommendations are co-created, the solutions are more likely to be
feasible and therefore the chance of having an effective consultation
and a positive impact is increased. This is associated with the final
mechanism through which these features are effective: treating the
Consultees as experts. By taking on board the views of the consultees
and seeing them as having expertise to bring to the discussion, the
consultation is more likely to be effective
[@truscottCreatingConsulteeChange2012]. Consultees will be more likely
to buy-in to the process if they feel valued and listened to and the
recommendations are more likely to be relevant if those who know the
school and CYP most are actively involved. Whilst this seems an
important feature, only a small number of interviewees explicitly
mentioned this as a valuable mechanism for effective consultations.

### 4.1.2 Which combination of features of consultation are seen with progress towards agreed goals?

#### 4.1.2.1 Non-formal analysis of features and goals

A majority of the goals were judged to have experienced progress,
bolstering the claim made in @dunsmuirEvidenceBasedPractice2009. Of
those which saw progress, patterns can be drawn. A qualitative
examination of the correspondence between features of consultation and
change revealed that consultations with fewer recorded instances of
Understanding the presenting problem were more likely to see change.
Such examples include the parent consultation for child 2 and the parent
consultation for child 4 (see Appendix L for all observed features and
change). There was also a greater number of instances of Suggesting
solutions by the EP during consultations which saw change, such as the
first consultation and the parent consultation for child 4.

There was a disparity between what interviewees stated was important and
what was observed in the consultations. Collaboration was given by
almost every interviewee as a crucial feature. However, observable
instances of this feature were less frequently seen than the EP
exploring the presenting problem for a majority of consultations. This
may represent a gap between what EPs say is important and what they
actually do in a consultation when they are there to support a specific
CYP in that context. It does, however, corroborate the importance of EPs
using parts of models e.g. the Problem-analysis framework. This is
because for each consultation the most frequently seen feature was
Understanding the presenting problem. This is substantiated by the fact
one of the EPs who was observed stated in their interview that the main
model they use in their practice is the Problem-analysis framework. On
the other hand, this emphasis on exploring the depth and limits of the
main problem may not reflect adherence to this model (and thus be
evidence for the importance of using said model). It may just be an
exploration of the main difficulties (and arguably the reason why the
consultation was organised in the first place). The absence of other
features of the Problem-analysis framework, such as discussing how to
implement an intervention, is suggestive of the perceived need by EPs to
fully understand the presenting problem rather than fully commit to a
certain model. This suggests a disparity between how EPs say they work
and what happens in a consultation.

The importance of the individual differences of the consultees was
highlighted in these observations, as consultees who were more
optimistic and less stressed were better able to engage collaboratively
and not focus as much on exploring the negative aspects of the
situation. Examples of these include the parent consultation for child 2
as the ratio between Understanding presenting problem and other features
was more even. The teacher consultation for child 2 was also an
opportunity to highlight the importance of emotionally supporting
consultees, given how upset the consultee was and therefore unable to
engage with one aspect of the consultation prior to said support.

The fact three putatively core features of effective consultation
(School knowledge, EP explaining role, and Planning/implementing
treatments) were not recorded once undermines the argument that they are
important for effective consultations. This is also true for Empowering
individuals as this was only recorded once. They do not appear to be
necessary and perhaps are not sufficient for change to be judged as
having occurred. Even though there were instances of the EP offering
solutions in most consultation, there was no discussion of the specifics
of how any suggestion was to be implemented (as there were no recorded
instances of Planning/implementing treatments). There was also no review
of any prior treatments. This raises questions as to how effective the
suggestions are. If they are left to the consultees to establish and
decide how often an intervention should be run for, will it be as
effective as if it were decided with the person who is believed to have
expert knowledge?

There was a lack of consistency regarding the discrepancy between the
ratings given by parents and teachers: one consultation saw the teacher
identifying change and the parent not, another saw the parent judging
there to have been progress but the teacher not. This reflects the fact
TME is based upon the perceptions of change by consultees and thus there
may be different conceptions and criteria for judging change between
consultees [@connorTargetMonitoringEvaluation2010]. However, the sample
is too small to draw any patterns or conclusions from this data.

#### 4.1.2.2 QCA

QCA identified three combination of features which were sufficient for
change after calibration and Boolean minimisation. The validity of QCA
for this data set is undermined as three goals which saw change
contained no features after calibration (goals for the parent
consultation of child 2). Therefore, limited conclusions can be drawn
from this analysis. The combinations which contain a mixture of present
and absent features will be explored. One such combination of conditions
which led to change was: Setting out consultation plan, Understanding
the presenting problem, Discussing what's already working, and Gathering
information. The other combination was: Ideas for future EP work,
Setting out consultation plan, EP using expert knowledge, Summarising,
and Suggesting solutions. Only one feature is shared between these
combinations (Setting out consultation plan). This gives tentative
support for the importance of establishing the consultation plan as this
feature was also observed during the other consultations which saw
change.

## 4.2 Limitations

### 4.2.1 Interviews

Despite the large amount of interview data, there are limitations with
the methods chosen and the data analysis. No measures were taken to
ensure the reliability of the TA, such as using inter-rater reliability.
It is therefore unknown to what extent the biases of the sole analyst of
the transcripts biased the analysis. There are also limitations of the
methodology employed (TA) as this provides only a surface level analysis
of codes and themes. As such, the depth of the data was not plumbed and
latent themes were not examined.

For the features that were identified, many were broad, ill defined
concepts such as 'collaborative' rather than features which could be
observed. This means that there were many features which were
inductively coded which could not have been used as deductive codes or
form part of the observation schedule. There is therefore the potential
that the observation schedule missed some core features due to the fact
many "features" of consultation are not operationalised.

There were also limitations of the tools used to conduct the interviews.
Although Zoom underwent security improvements, there was still a risk of
interferene or data loss which are not present in face-to-face
interviews. To mitigate this risk, the in-built recording function was
not used. There were also connectivity issues present in a few
consultations. Typically only a few words were lost, but it is unknown
how much of an impact this may have had on the contents of the
interviews. There were also three interviews which interrupted by family
members. Whilst this did not directly lead to a loss of data, it
interrupted the flow of the interview and may have impacted on what the
interviewee said. It is unknown how great an impact these factors had on
the TA, although the risk of codes or themes being lost due to them is
minimised because of the amount of data collected.

Another limitation related to the use of video technology, and one which
speaks to the heart of tech consultations, relates to the level of
engagement of consultees. Whilst tech consultations can increase
accessibility for consultees, they can also result in consultees
participating in other activities during the consultation. This reduces
their ability to focus and thus potentially understand certain parts of
the consultation. For example, during the establishing goals phase at
the end of the joint home-school consultation for child 1, the parent
was driving and thus could not engage as fully. This likely led to the
parent being unable to give a rating for the second goal as they did not
understand it. Therefore, tech consultations may undermine the efficacy
of consultations because consultees may not have the mental space to
fully give to the consultation, thus undermining engagement. This
reduces the ability of the results to generalise to face-to-face
consultation, as such distractions are less likely when everyone is in
the same room together.

### 4.2.2 Observations

#### 4.2.2.1 Methodological

There were a number of potential methodological limitations of the
chosen methods for the quantitative arm of the research. One such
concern related to the nature of the features. By limiting the features
to what was explicitly said, features such as body language and more
abstract features were necessarily excluded from the analysis.
Therefore, potentially valuable features may have been missed. A related
issue concerned the nature of recording the presence of features. As
there was only one observer, there is a risk of subjective
interpretation of features. The ICC of the observation checklist was
under 0.5 and therefore, by the standards given by
@kooGuidelineSelectingReporting2016, is 'poor'. Thus there is the
potential for unreliability in the recording of the features.

One component of solution-focused approaches (exploring exceptions) was
not included in the observation schedule due to a clerical error. Thus,
instances of an observed feature which was mentioned by interviewees was
missed. This undermines the validity of the observation results. Another
issue relating to the features included in the observation schedule
related to their potential thoroughness. The large disparity between the
theoretically derived codes and the inductive codes suggests the current
literature does not capture the breadth of features present in
consultation. Whilst the features of consultation were supported in
previous work, it was a small-scale project limited to a small number of
EPs. Therefore, the observation schedule may be missing key features of
an effective consultation. This undermines the validity of the
quantitative results.

Another potential limitation related to the use of TME. This tool has
not been demonstrated as being a suitable measure of the effectiveness
of consultation. There is evidence to suggest it can be used to measure
change for a child on a given goal, for example
[@connorTargetMonitoringEvaluation2010]. However, as this same thesis
identified, it is very difficult to attribute the observed change to the
consultation itself due to the large number of occurrences and other
factors which may influence the rating of change.

There were also limitations of the measurement of progress: TME. There
is evidence to suggest TME may be a valid tool for measuring change for
CYP [@connorTargetMonitoringEvaluation2010]. But the psychometric
validity of TME for evaluating EP practice and specifically consultation
has yet to be demonstrated. Without rigorous identification of
interventions or means to support the CYP and follow-up to confirm these
happen, we cannot know how much of an impact the consultation had on the
consultees and the consequent impact on the CYP.

There was another practical issue with the use of TME for this research.
The majority of consultations (four of the six) took place prior to the
Christmas holidays which was followed by a national lockdown. The
children therefore spent a majority of the 6-8 week period out of school
where most of their support was expected to be delivered. This may have
resulted in the children making less progress than predicted, given the
extended time they were away from school.

#### 4.2.2.2 Sample

The initial conception of the research limited observations to joint
home-school consultations. However, due to the difficulty in arranging
such observations, the scope was broadened to any consultation. Since
the interviews occurred prior to the observations, when the research
questions focused solely on joint home-school consultations,
interviewees may have put the focus of their answers on joint
home-school consultations. One interviewee made such a comment. It is
therefore unknown whether the answers from the interviewees would be
different if the scope of the questions had been broader from the
beginning. However, most interviewees seemed to approach the questions
with consultations in general in mind. Thus, one can be reasonably
confident the qualitative data results are similar to what would have
otherwise been seen. The number of interviews (30) also helped reduce
the impact this more narrow a focus some interviewees had towards the
questions.

Issues with the generalisability of the findings were raised due to the
fact the observations were almost exclusively from one EP. Both EPs
observed worked in the same LA and all the observed consultations were
remote. We therefore cannot be certain that the findings extend to other
EPs in other LAs and to in-person consultations. The issue of
generalisability is also raised by the fact one of the consultations
(the parent consultation for child 4), the main body was dictated by the
use of the Cognitive abilities profile. This highly structured tool
therefore involved a large number of questions exploring the presenting
problem and other areas. As such, it may not be representative of a
consultation which does not use that tool or is less structured.

#### 4.2.2.3 QCA

QCA is a valuable tool for examining causal patterns in conditions for
complex phenomena. However, @marxCrispSetQualitativeComparative2011
recommend eschewing QCA when there are more conditions than cases. This
is because of the increased risk of each case forming a unique
configuration, which invalidates the ability of QCA to find common
combinations. There is also an increased chance of the data being random
but still finding an explanatory model
[@marxCrispsetQualitativeComparative2010]. This appears to be the case
for the present data set. There were 10 cases (six of which had unique
features) and 14 conditions. There was therefore an increased risk of
being unable to find meaningful combinations of conditions to glean
patterns. The results showed that each combination only corresponded to
one consultation with very little overlap between combinations. This
made drawing conclusions regarding the consistent combination of
features to change very difficult. Another issue related to the
calibration thresholds. Using the mean as the threshold resulted in the
consultation which saw the most change (parent consultation for child 2)
recording no features present. This undermines the ability to draw
conclusions regarding combinations of conditions. A more appropriate
threshold would be one weighted by the total number of observations per
case. This would overcome the problem of some cases containing a higher
number of features and thus consigning other cases to record no features
after calibration.

## 4.3 Future directions

Despite the limitations put forward in section 4.2.2, the use of an
observation schedule and QCA to explore combinations of causal
conditions is valid. To increase the chance of meaningful conclusions
being drawn, a greater number of consultations should be observed. There
would thus be a more conducive case to condition ratio, for example at
least 30 cases to the 14 conditions. TME could be used again as the
measure of change, although this could be done in tandem with other more
robust measures, as was done in @connorTargetMonitoringEvaluation2010.

Alternatively, another measure of consultation efficacy could be
developed. This measure would focus on a mechanism by which consultation
can have a direct impact on the consultees. For example, by changing the
perspectives of the consultees. This could be in relation to feeling
better able to support the CYP or more hopeful for the future. A
multi-item questionnaire exploring the construct(s) would be presented
to the consultees before and after the consultation. This same
questionnaire could be presented a few months later to see how long-term
the change in perspectives for the consultee(s) is (if at all). How
perspective change then impacts the CYP could be explored through
interviews or questionnaires, as potentially increased support may be
given, or the consultees may have a more positive outlook for the CYP.

The present data presents opportunities for further work. Given the
surface level analysis of the interview transcripts, there is large
amount of data not yet examined. The use of Grounded theory
[@straussGroundedTheoryMethodology] or Interpretative Phenomenological
Analysis [@smithInterpretativePhenomenologicalAnalysis2003] may allow a
more detailed exploration of the latent themes within the data.

## 4.4 Researcher reflections

This section will explore my reflections on the research process and
what I have learned from conducting this piece of research. Prior to
developing this work, I did not value qualitative research
methodologies. I did not understand them and consequently did not
believe they could be used to explore complex phenomena in a meaningful.
Learning about TA and utilising it in this research has thoroughly
dissuaded me of that notion. I now clearly understand why qualitative
research methods are used and their value. I will be integrating them
into my future research as I believe mixed methods research is the most
robust and comprehensive means of examining something like consultation.
Whilst the process of TA was laborious, the results were worth the time
spent. I take satisfaction in the ease with which the themes revealed
themselves after the rounds of coding the transcripts. This suggests
that the methodology was robust and allowed for the detailing of what I
sought to examine (the effective features of consultation). I am also
grateful I sent out several calls for participants. The large number of
interviews presented the opportunity to create very rich data about the
views regarding effective consultations from a wide range of EPs.

This work has been greatly affected by the global pandemic. However,
these difficulties presented the possibility to expand the scope of this
work and it has been improved for it. I have also been presented with an
opportunity to explore consultation as it will likely be performed in
the future: as technologically mediated consultations. Whilst tech
consultations are unlikely to replace face-to-face consultations
entirely, they will undoubtedly form an integral part of the EP working
landscape in the future. Thus, to have explored their use and what makes
them effective is highly valuable and can help EPs ensure their
consultations are effective.

The development and conducting of this research has been the most
rewarding piece of work I have ever done. To deeply delve into the
theoretical background of consultation and then explore it through
qualitative and quantitative methods has given me valuable insight into
consultation. I am very grateful for the opportunity to have done this
work. Engaging in this exploration of consultation has solidified my
desire to employ this as my primary model of working. I have seen the
power of consultation over the more traditional styles of EP work and
have been fully persuaded of its utility. This has strengthened my
resolve to continue researching it and make it as effective as possible.
Not just for the children and young people it is used in service of, or
the consultees who engage in it, but other EPs who use this methodology.
We are in a privileged position to help those in very difficult
situations. It is therefore of imperative importance that the methods we
use are evidence-based and have rigorously shown benefit for those
involved.

## 4.5 Conclusions

This piece of work represents an attempt to systematically identify the
features of consultation which lead to change for CYP. By employing a
mixed methods approach, the beliefs of practicing EPs regarding the
effective features of consultation were detailed, along with recorded
instances of various features of consultation. These recordings were
tabulated against measures of change for co-operatively agreed goals by
the EP and consultees. The relative presence or absence of said features
were then analysed to see if patterns of features could be identified.
Whilst statistical analyses did not yield conclusive results, the
breadth of qualitative data combined with the non-formal analysis of
features and ratings of change present a picture of what is necessary
for an effective consultation.

To lead an effective consultation, EPs need to have specialist knowledge
to thoroughly explore an area of need for a child or young person. By
creating a collaborative space in which consultees feel valued, through
the development of rapport and encouraging the participation of
consultees, EPs can hope to change the perspectives of those involved
and identify potential solutions. By exploring the views of consultees
and using various questions, a shared understanding of the CYP and
situation can be created. Through consultation, EPs can impact not only
those involved in the consultation, by providing therapeutic support,
but those outside the consultation through the ripple effects
consultation can have on people and systems. By being collaborative,
consultees can not only feel empowered to support CYP but to take
ownership of the situation and actively work to improve the situation
for all.

Consultation is fundamental to the work of EPs in the U.K. and Republic
of Ireland. Yet there remain significant questions as to what
constitutes consultation and how it can be effective in supporting CYP.
This presents great challenges to TEPs and EPs alike, resulting in many
claiming to practice consultation when in fact they do not. It is
therefore of vital importance for us as a profession to clarify what we
mean by consultation and how we can engage in it effectively. My hope is
that this work can go some way in shining a light on the core features
of an effective consultation and thus empower EPs to lead consultations
which improve the lives of those we seek to help.
